Most of the patients had prior infliximab therapy as well as%0A                        concomitant azathioprine or 6- mercaptopurine use for Crohn%E2%80%99s disease. The%0A                        potential risk with the combination of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and%0A                        adalimumab injection should be carefully considered. The causal association%0A                        of HSTCL with adalimumab injection is not clear.Infections Serious infections due to%0A                        bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal (disseminated or extrapulmonary%0A                        histoplasmosis, aspergillosis, coccidiodomycosis), viral, parasitic, or%0A                        other opportunistic infections have been reported in patients receiving%0A                        tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- blocking agents. Sepsis, rare cases of%0A                        tuberculosis, candidiasis, listeriosis, legionellosis and pneumocystis have%0A                        also been reported with the use of TNF-blocking agents, including adalimumab%0A                        injection. Other serious infections seen in clinical trials include%0A                        pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and septicemia. Hospitalization%0A                        or fatal outcomes associated with infections have been reported. Many of the%0A                        serious infections have occurred in patients on concomitant%0A                        immunosuppressive therapy that, in addition to their underlying disease,%0A                        could predispose them to infections.

In%0A                        patients who have been exposed to tuberculosis, and patients who have%0A                        travelled in areas of high risk of tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as%0A                        histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis, the risk and benefits%0A                        of treatment with HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                          PushTouchTM) should be considered prior to initiating therapy.%0A                        See (WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Infections, Other%0A                          Opportunistic Infections). As with other TNF-blockers,%0A                        patients should be monitored closely for infections (including tuberculosis)%0A                        before, during and after treatment with HADLIMATM (or%0A                          HADLIMATM PushTouchTM). Patients who%0A                        develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with HADLIMATM%0A                        (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) should be monitored closely%0A                        and undergo a complete diagnostic evaluation. Administration of%0A                          HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                        should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis,%0A                        and appropriate antimicrobial or antifungal therapy should be%0A                        initiated. Physicians should exercise caution when considering the%0A                        use of HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                        in patients with a history of recurrent infection or with underlying%0A                        conditions which may predispose them to infections, or patients who have%0A                        resided in regions where tuberculosis and histoplasmosis are endemic.

Adalimumab injection has fully human heavy and light chain variable%0A                  regions, which confer specificity to human tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and human%0A                  IgG1 heavy chain and kappa light chain sequences. Adalimumab injection binds with%0A                  high affinity and specificity to soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) but not%0A                  lymphotoxin (TNF-beta). Adalimumab injection is produced by recombinant DNA%0A                  technology in a mammalian cell expression system. It consists of 1,330 amino acids%0A                  and has a molecular weight of approximately 148 kilodaltons.8 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS sample text 8.1 SPECIAL POPULATIONS sample text 8.1.1 PREGNANT WOMEN sample text 8.1.2 BREAST-FEEDING sample text 8.1.3 PEDIATRICS sample text 8.1.4 GERIATRICS sample text 9 ADVERSE REACTIONS sample text 9.1 ADVERSE REACTION OVERVIEW sample text 9.2 CLINICAL TRIAL ADVERSE REACTIONS sample text 9.3 LESS COMMON CLINICAL TRIAL ADVERSE REACTIONS sample text 9.4 ABNORMAL LABORATORY FINDINGS: HEMATOLOGIC, CLINICAL CHEMISTRY AND OTHER QUANTITATIVE DATA sample text 9.5 CLINICAL TRIAL ADVERSE REACTIONS (PEDIATRICS) sample text 9.6 POST-MARKET ADVERSE REACTIONS sample text 10 DRUG INTERACTIONS sample text 10.1 SERIOUS DRUG INTERACTIONS BOX sample text 10.2 OVERVIEW sample text 10.3 DRUG-DRUG INTERACTIONS sample text 10.4 DRUG-FOOD INTERACTIONS sample text 10.5 DRUG-HERB INTERACTIONS sample text 10.6 DRUG-LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS sample text 10.7 DRUG-LIFESTYLE INTERACTIONS sample text 11 ACTION AND CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY sample text 11.1 MECHANISM OF ACTION sample text 11.2 PHARMACODYNAMICS sample text 11.3 PHARMACOKINETICS sample text 12 STORAGE, STABILITY AND DISPOSAL sample text 13 SPECIAL HANDLING INSTRUCTIONS sample text 3 SERIOUS WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS BOXSerious Warnings and PrecautionsHepatosplenic T-Cell%0A                        Lymphoma Very rare post-marketing reports of%0A                        hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare aggressive lymphoma that is%0A                        often fatal, have been identified in patients treated with adalimumab%0A                        injection.

The causal association%0A                        of HSTCL with adalimumab injection is not clear.Infections Serious infections due to%0A                        bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal (disseminated or extrapulmonary%0A                        histoplasmosis, aspergillosis, coccidiodomycosis), viral, parasitic, or%0A                        other opportunistic infections have been reported in patients receiving%0A                        tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- blocking agents. Sepsis, rare cases of%0A                        tuberculosis, candidiasis, listeriosis, legionellosis and pneumocystis have%0A                        also been reported with the use of TNF-blocking agents, including adalimumab%0A                        injection. Other serious infections seen in clinical trials include%0A                        pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and septicemia. Hospitalization%0A                        or fatal outcomes associated with infections have been reported. Many of the%0A                        serious infections have occurred in patients on concomitant%0A                        immunosuppressive therapy that, in addition to their underlying disease,%0A                        could predispose them to infections.

Most of the patients had prior infliximab therapy as well as%0A                        concomitant azathioprine or 6- mercaptopurine use for Crohn%E2%80%99s disease. The%0A                        potential risk with the combination of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and%0A                        adalimumab injection should be carefully considered. The causal association%0A                        of HSTCL with adalimumab injection is not clear.Infections Serious infections due to%0A                        bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal (disseminated or extrapulmonary%0A                        histoplasmosis, aspergillosis, coccidiodomycosis), viral, parasitic, or%0A                        other opportunistic infections have been reported in patients receiving%0A                        tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- blocking agents. Sepsis, rare cases of%0A                        tuberculosis, candidiasis, listeriosis, legionellosis and pneumocystis have%0A                        also been reported with the use of TNF-blocking agents, including adalimumab%0A                        injection. Other serious infections seen in clinical trials include%0A                        pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and septicemia. Hospitalization%0A                        or fatal outcomes associated with infections have been reported. Many of the%0A                        serious infections have occurred in patients on concomitant%0A                        immunosuppressive therapy that, in addition to their underlying disease,%0A                        could predispose them to infections.

Adalimumab injection has fully human heavy and light chain variable%0A                  regions, which confer specificity to human tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and human%0A                  IgG1 heavy chain and kappa light chain sequences. Adalimumab injection binds with%0A                  high affinity and specificity to soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) but not%0A                  lymphotoxin (TNF-beta). Adalimumab injection is produced by recombinant DNA%0A                  technology in a mammalian cell expression system. It consists of 1,330 amino acids%0A                  and has a molecular weight of approximately 148 kilodaltons.8 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS sample text 8.1 SPECIAL POPULATIONS sample text 8.1.1 PREGNANT WOMEN sample text 8.1.2 BREAST-FEEDING sample text 8.1.3 PEDIATRICS sample text 8.1.4 GERIATRICS sample text 9 ADVERSE REACTIONS sample text 9.1 ADVERSE REACTION OVERVIEW sample text 9.2 CLINICAL TRIAL ADVERSE REACTIONS sample text 9.3 LESS COMMON CLINICAL TRIAL ADVERSE REACTIONS sample text 9.4 ABNORMAL LABORATORY FINDINGS: HEMATOLOGIC, CLINICAL CHEMISTRY AND OTHER QUANTITATIVE DATA sample text 9.5 CLINICAL TRIAL ADVERSE REACTIONS (PEDIATRICS) sample text 9.6 POST-MARKET ADVERSE REACTIONS sample text 10 DRUG INTERACTIONS sample text 10.1 SERIOUS DRUG INTERACTIONS BOX sample text 10.2 OVERVIEW sample text 10.3 DRUG-DRUG INTERACTIONS sample text 10.4 DRUG-FOOD INTERACTIONS sample text 10.5 DRUG-HERB INTERACTIONS sample text 10.6 DRUG-LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS sample text 10.7 DRUG-LIFESTYLE INTERACTIONS sample text 11 ACTION AND CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY sample text 11.1 MECHANISM OF ACTION sample text 11.2 PHARMACODYNAMICS sample text 11.3 PHARMACOKINETICS sample text 12 STORAGE, STABILITY AND DISPOSAL sample text 13 SPECIAL HANDLING INSTRUCTIONS sample text 6 DOSAGE FORMS, STRENGTHS, COMPOSITION AND PACKAGINGsample text Table - Dosage Forms, Strengths, Composition and PackagingRoute of%0A                          AdministrationDosage%0A                          Form / Strength/CompositionNon-medicinal IngredientsSubcutaneous injection (s.c.)Sterile solution (in either%0A                        auto-injector or pre-filled syringe) /40 mg adalimumab injection in 0.8 mL%0A                        (50 mg/mL)citric acid monohydrate, sodium%0A                        citrate dihydrate, L-histidine, L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate,%0A                        sorbitol, polysorbate 20, and water for injection HADLIMATM or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM%0A                  (adalimumab injection) is supplied as a sterile solution for subcutaneous%0A                  administration in the following packaging configurations:Auto-injector HADLIMATM%0A                    PushTouchTM is available as an auto-injector in a carton containing%0A                  two dose trays.

Like all medicines that affect your/your child%E2%80%99s%0A                          immune system, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can cause serious side%0A                          effects. The possible serious side effects include:Allergic%0A                                reactions: If you/your child develop a severe%0A                            rash, swollen face or difficulty breathing while taking HADLIMATM (or%0A                            HADLIMATM PushTouchTM), call your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right away.%0A                          Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma: Very rare%0A                            reports of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare serious%0A                            lymphoma that is often fatal, have been identified in patients treated%0A                            with adalimumab injection. Most patients had also been treated with%0A                            other medications for Crohn%E2%80%99s disease and the majority were in%0A                            adolescent and young adult males. The link between HSTCL and adalimumab%0A                            injection is not clear.Other%0A                                cancers: There have been very rare cases of%0A                            certain kinds of cancer in patients taking adalimumab injection or other%0A                            TNF-blockers. Some patients receiving adalimumab injection have%0A                            developed types of cancer called non-melanoma skin cancer. Tell%0A                            your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor if you/your child have a bump or open sore that%0A                            does not heal. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have%0A                            had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of%0A                            getting a kind of cancer that affects the lymph system, called lymphoma.%0A                            If you/your child take HADLIMATM, HADLIMATM PushTouchTM, or other TNF-%0A                            blockers, your/your child%E2%80%99s risk may increase.

Some of these cases have been%0A                            life-threatening. Such infections include tuberculosis, infections%0A                            caused by bacteria or fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread%0A                            throughout the body (sepsis). Infection causes include tuberculosis,%0A                            legionellosis (a serious form of bacterial pneumonia), listeriosis (an%0A                            infection that usually develops after eating food contaminated by%0A                            bacteria called listeria), and very rare cases of hepatitis B infection%0A                            relapse.Blood%0A                                problems: In some instances, patients treated%0A                            with TNF-blocking agents may develop low blood counts, such as anemia%0A                            (low red blood cells) or low platelets. If you/your child develop%0A                            symptoms such as persistent fever, bleeding, or bruising, you should%0A                            contact your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right awayWHAT IS THIS MEDICATION USED FOR?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) treatment should be started and%0A                  supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of%0A                  rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA),%0A                  psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), adult Crohn%E2%80%99s disease%0A                  (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), adult hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), psoriasis (Ps)%0A                  or adult uveitis, and familiar with the HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                  efficacy and safety profile. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a%0A                  medicine that is used in:adults with rheumatoid arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints.adults with psoriatic arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints and skin.adults with ankylosing spondylitis, which is a form of arthritis.adults with Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    digestive tract.pediatrics with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who are 4 years%0A                    of age and older and require a full 40 mg dose based on body weight and%0A                    height.adults with ulcerative colitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    bowel (colon).adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) who have not%0A                    responded to antibiotics. HS is a painful, progressive, chronic inflammatory%0A                    skin disease that causes nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts and fistulas under the%0A                    breasts, underarms, buttocks and groin.adults with psoriasis, which is an inflammatory disease of the skin. The%0A                    doctor prescribed HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and%0A                    symptoms of your plaque psoriasis.adults with uveitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the eye. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic%0A                  arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, hidradenitis suppurativa,%0A                  psoriasis, or uveitis may be given other medicines for their disease before they%0A                  are given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM). If you have ulcerative colitis or%0A                  Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond%0A                  well enough to these medicines, you will be given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. HOW DOES THIS MEDICATION WORK?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a fully human monoclonal antibody%0A                  produced by cultured cells. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognize and%0A                  bind to other unique proteins. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) binds to a%0A                  specific protein called TNF- alpha (also known as tumor necrosis factor). People%0A                  with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease, ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa or psoriasis have too much%0A                  of TNF-alpha in their bodies. The extra TNF-alpha in your/your child%E2%80%99s body can%0A                  attack normal healthy body tissues and cause inflammation, especially in the%0A                  tissues of your /your child%E2%80%99s bones, cartilage, joints, digestive tract and skin.%0A                  By binding to TNF-alpha, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) decreases the%0A                  inflammation process of these diseases. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis,%0A                  polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis (such as pain%0A                  and swollen joints), may help improve your/your child%E2%80%99s ability to perform daily%0A                  activities (such as getting dressed, walking and climbing stairs), and may help%0A                  prevent further damage to your/your child%E2%80%99s bones and joints. In addition,%0A                  HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of%0A                  ankylosing spondylitis (back pain and morning stiffness), and adult Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease or ulcerative colitis (abdominal pain and diarrhea). HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is also used to treat inflammatory lesions (nodules and%0A                  abscesses) in adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) also helps reduce the signs and symptoms of psoriasis%0A                  (such as pain, itching and scaly patches on skin). HADLIMATM (or%0A                  HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps control uveitis by reducing the risk of inflammation%0A                  and loss of vision in adult patients.

Most patients had also been treated with%0A                            other medications for Crohn%E2%80%99s disease and the majority were in%0A                            adolescent and young adult males. The link between HSTCL and adalimumab%0A                            injection is not clear.Other%0A                                cancers: There have been very rare cases of%0A                            certain kinds of cancer in patients taking adalimumab injection or other%0A                            TNF-blockers. Some patients receiving adalimumab injection have%0A                            developed types of cancer called non-melanoma skin cancer. Tell%0A                            your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor if you/your child have a bump or open sore that%0A                            does not heal. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have%0A                            had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of%0A                            getting a kind of cancer that affects the lymph system, called lymphoma.%0A                            If you/your child take HADLIMATM, HADLIMATM PushTouchTM, or other TNF-%0A                            blockers, your/your child%E2%80%99s risk may increase.

Some of these cases have been%0A                            life-threatening. Such infections include tuberculosis, infections%0A                            caused by bacteria or fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread%0A                            throughout the body (sepsis). Infection causes include tuberculosis,%0A                            legionellosis (a serious form of bacterial pneumonia), listeriosis (an%0A                            infection that usually develops after eating food contaminated by%0A                            bacteria called listeria), and very rare cases of hepatitis B infection%0A                            relapse.Blood%0A                                problems: In some instances, patients treated%0A                            with TNF-blocking agents may develop low blood counts, such as anemia%0A                            (low red blood cells) or low platelets. If you/your child develop%0A                            symptoms such as persistent fever, bleeding, or bruising, you should%0A                            contact your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right awayWHAT IS THIS MEDICATION USED FOR?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) treatment should be started and%0A                  supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of%0A                  rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA),%0A                  psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), adult Crohn%E2%80%99s disease%0A                  (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), adult hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), psoriasis (Ps)%0A                  or adult uveitis, and familiar with the HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                  efficacy and safety profile. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a%0A                  medicine that is used in:adults with rheumatoid arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints.adults with psoriatic arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints and skin.adults with ankylosing spondylitis, which is a form of arthritis.adults with Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    digestive tract.pediatrics with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who are 4 years%0A                    of age and older and require a full 40 mg dose based on body weight and%0A                    height.adults with ulcerative colitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    bowel (colon).adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) who have not%0A                    responded to antibiotics. HS is a painful, progressive, chronic inflammatory%0A                    skin disease that causes nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts and fistulas under the%0A                    breasts, underarms, buttocks and groin.adults with psoriasis, which is an inflammatory disease of the skin. The%0A                    doctor prescribed HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and%0A                    symptoms of your plaque psoriasis.adults with uveitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the eye. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic%0A                  arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, hidradenitis suppurativa,%0A                  psoriasis, or uveitis may be given other medicines for their disease before they%0A                  are given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM). If you have ulcerative colitis or%0A                  Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond%0A                  well enough to these medicines, you will be given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. HOW DOES THIS MEDICATION WORK?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a fully human monoclonal antibody%0A                  produced by cultured cells. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognize and%0A                  bind to other unique proteins. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) binds to a%0A                  specific protein called TNF- alpha (also known as tumor necrosis factor). People%0A                  with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease, ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa or psoriasis have too much%0A                  of TNF-alpha in their bodies. The extra TNF-alpha in your/your child%E2%80%99s body can%0A                  attack normal healthy body tissues and cause inflammation, especially in the%0A                  tissues of your /your child%E2%80%99s bones, cartilage, joints, digestive tract and skin.%0A                  By binding to TNF-alpha, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) decreases the%0A                  inflammation process of these diseases. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis,%0A                  polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis (such as pain%0A                  and swollen joints), may help improve your/your child%E2%80%99s ability to perform daily%0A                  activities (such as getting dressed, walking and climbing stairs), and may help%0A                  prevent further damage to your/your child%E2%80%99s bones and joints. In addition,%0A                  HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of%0A                  ankylosing spondylitis (back pain and morning stiffness), and adult Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease or ulcerative colitis (abdominal pain and diarrhea). HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is also used to treat inflammatory lesions (nodules and%0A                  abscesses) in adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) also helps reduce the signs and symptoms of psoriasis%0A                  (such as pain, itching and scaly patches on skin). HADLIMATM (or%0A                  HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps control uveitis by reducing the risk of inflammation%0A                  and loss of vision in adult patients. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM), however, can also lower your/your child%E2%80%99s body%E2%80%99s ability to fight%0A                  infections.

Like all medicines that affect your/your child%E2%80%99s%0A                          immune system, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can cause serious side%0A                          effects. The possible serious side effects include:Allergic%0A                                reactions: If you/your child develop a severe%0A                            rash, swollen face or difficulty breathing while taking HADLIMATM (or%0A                            HADLIMATM PushTouchTM), call your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right away.%0A                          Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma: Very rare%0A                            reports of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare serious%0A                            lymphoma that is often fatal, have been identified in patients treated%0A                            with adalimumab injection. Most patients had also been treated with%0A                            other medications for Crohn%E2%80%99s disease and the majority were in%0A                            adolescent and young adult males. The link between HSTCL and adalimumab%0A                            injection is not clear.Other%0A                                cancers: There have been very rare cases of%0A                            certain kinds of cancer in patients taking adalimumab injection or other%0A                            TNF-blockers. Some patients receiving adalimumab injection have%0A                            developed types of cancer called non-melanoma skin cancer. Tell%0A                            your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor if you/your child have a bump or open sore that%0A                            does not heal. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have%0A                            had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of%0A                            getting a kind of cancer that affects the lymph system, called lymphoma.%0A                            If you/your child take HADLIMATM, HADLIMATM PushTouchTM, or other TNF-%0A                            blockers, your/your child%E2%80%99s risk may increase.

Some of these cases have been%0A                            life-threatening. Such infections include tuberculosis, infections%0A                            caused by bacteria or fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread%0A                            throughout the body (sepsis). Infection causes include tuberculosis,%0A                            legionellosis (a serious form of bacterial pneumonia), listeriosis (an%0A                            infection that usually develops after eating food contaminated by%0A                            bacteria called listeria), and very rare cases of hepatitis B infection%0A                            relapse.Blood%0A                                problems: In some instances, patients treated%0A                            with TNF-blocking agents may develop low blood counts, such as anemia%0A                            (low red blood cells) or low platelets. If you/your child develop%0A                            symptoms such as persistent fever, bleeding, or bruising, you should%0A                            contact your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right awayWHAT IS THIS MEDICATION USED FOR?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) treatment should be started and%0A                  supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of%0A                  rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA),%0A                  psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), adult Crohn%E2%80%99s disease%0A                  (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), adult hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), psoriasis (Ps)%0A                  or adult uveitis, and familiar with the HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                  efficacy and safety profile. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a%0A                  medicine that is used in:adults with rheumatoid arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints.adults with psoriatic arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints and skin.adults with ankylosing spondylitis, which is a form of arthritis.adults with Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    digestive tract.pediatrics with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who are 4 years%0A                    of age and older and require a full 40 mg dose based on body weight and%0A                    height.adults with ulcerative colitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    bowel (colon).adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) who have not%0A                    responded to antibiotics. HS is a painful, progressive, chronic inflammatory%0A                    skin disease that causes nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts and fistulas under the%0A                    breasts, underarms, buttocks and groin.adults with psoriasis, which is an inflammatory disease of the skin. The%0A                    doctor prescribed HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and%0A                    symptoms of your plaque psoriasis.adults with uveitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the eye. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic%0A                  arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, hidradenitis suppurativa,%0A                  psoriasis, or uveitis may be given other medicines for their disease before they%0A                  are given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM). If you have ulcerative colitis or%0A                  Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond%0A                  well enough to these medicines, you will be given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. HOW DOES THIS MEDICATION WORK?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a fully human monoclonal antibody%0A                  produced by cultured cells. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognize and%0A                  bind to other unique proteins. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) binds to a%0A                  specific protein called TNF- alpha (also known as tumor necrosis factor). People%0A                  with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease, ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa or psoriasis have too much%0A                  of TNF-alpha in their bodies. The extra TNF-alpha in your/your child%E2%80%99s body can%0A                  attack normal healthy body tissues and cause inflammation, especially in the%0A                  tissues of your /your child%E2%80%99s bones, cartilage, joints, digestive tract and skin.%0A                  By binding to TNF-alpha, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) decreases the%0A                  inflammation process of these diseases. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis,%0A                  polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis (such as pain%0A                  and swollen joints), may help improve your/your child%E2%80%99s ability to perform daily%0A                  activities (such as getting dressed, walking and climbing stairs), and may help%0A                  prevent further damage to your/your child%E2%80%99s bones and joints. In addition,%0A                  HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of%0A                  ankylosing spondylitis (back pain and morning stiffness), and adult Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease or ulcerative colitis (abdominal pain and diarrhea). HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is also used to treat inflammatory lesions (nodules and%0A                  abscesses) in adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) also helps reduce the signs and symptoms of psoriasis%0A                  (such as pain, itching and scaly patches on skin). HADLIMATM (or%0A                  HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps control uveitis by reducing the risk of inflammation%0A                  and loss of vision in adult patients. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM), however, can also lower your/your child%E2%80%99s body%E2%80%99s ability to fight%0A                  infections. Taking HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can make you/your child%0A                  more prone to getting infections or make any infection you/your child have%0A                  worse.WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS IN THIS MEDICATION?Medicinal ingredients: adalimumab injection Non-medicinal%0A                  ingredients: citric acid monohydrate, sodium citrate dihydrate, L-histidine, L-%0A                  histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sorbitol, polysorbate 20, water for%0A                  injectionTHIS MEDICATION COMES IN THE FOLLOWING DOSAGE FORMS:Single-use, 1 mL auto-injector containing 40 mg adalimumab injection%0A                    dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL)Single-use, 1 mL pre-filled glass syringe containing 40 mg adalimumab%0A                    injection dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL) All packaging components are latex-free.DO NOT USE THIS MEDICATION IF:You/your child should not take HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) if%0A                  you/your child have:an allergy to any of the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                    (see What are the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or%0A                      HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)? section).a serious infection such as tuberculosis, infections caused by bacteria or%0A                    fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread throughout the body%0A                    (sepsis).moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV).TO HELP AVOID SIDE EFFECTS AND ENSURE PROPER USE, TALK TO YOUR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS MEDICATION.

                            TNF-blockers. Some patients receiving adalimumab injection have
                            developed types of cancer called non-melanoma skin cancer. Tell
                            your/your child’s doctor if you/your child have a bump or open sore that
                            does not heal. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have
                            had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of
                            getting a kind of cancer that affects the lymph system, called lymphoma.

                            blockers, your/your child’s risk may increase. There have been cases of
                            lymphoma and other cancers, including unusual types, in children,
                            adolescents and young adults taking TNF-blocking agents, including
                            adalimumab injection, which sometimes resulted in death. For children
                            and adults taking TNF-blocker medicines, the chances of developing

HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a%0A                  medicine that is used in:adults with rheumatoid arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints.adults with psoriatic arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints and skin.adults with ankylosing spondylitis, which is a form of arthritis.adults with Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    digestive tract.pediatrics with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who are 4 years%0A                    of age and older and require a full 40 mg dose based on body weight and%0A                    height.adults with ulcerative colitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    bowel (colon).adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) who have not%0A                    responded to antibiotics. HS is a painful, progressive, chronic inflammatory%0A                    skin disease that causes nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts and fistulas under the%0A                    breasts, underarms, buttocks and groin.adults with psoriasis, which is an inflammatory disease of the skin. The%0A                    doctor prescribed HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and%0A                    symptoms of your plaque psoriasis.adults with uveitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the eye. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic%0A                  arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, hidradenitis suppurativa,%0A                  psoriasis, or uveitis may be given other medicines for their disease before they%0A                  are given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM). If you have ulcerative colitis or%0A                  Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond%0A                  well enough to these medicines, you will be given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. HOW DOES THIS MEDICATION WORK?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a fully human monoclonal antibody%0A                  produced by cultured cells. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognize and%0A                  bind to other unique proteins. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) binds to a%0A                  specific protein called TNF- alpha (also known as tumor necrosis factor). People%0A                  with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease, ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa or psoriasis have too much%0A                  of TNF-alpha in their bodies. The extra TNF-alpha in your/your child%E2%80%99s body can%0A                  attack normal healthy body tissues and cause inflammation, especially in the%0A                  tissues of your /your child%E2%80%99s bones, cartilage, joints, digestive tract and skin.%0A                  By binding to TNF-alpha, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) decreases the%0A                  inflammation process of these diseases. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis,%0A                  polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis (such as pain%0A                  and swollen joints), may help improve your/your child%E2%80%99s ability to perform daily%0A                  activities (such as getting dressed, walking and climbing stairs), and may help%0A                  prevent further damage to your/your child%E2%80%99s bones and joints. In addition,%0A                  HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of%0A                  ankylosing spondylitis (back pain and morning stiffness), and adult Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease or ulcerative colitis (abdominal pain and diarrhea). HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is also used to treat inflammatory lesions (nodules and%0A                  abscesses) in adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) also helps reduce the signs and symptoms of psoriasis%0A                  (such as pain, itching and scaly patches on skin). HADLIMATM (or%0A                  HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps control uveitis by reducing the risk of inflammation%0A                  and loss of vision in adult patients. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM), however, can also lower your/your child%E2%80%99s body%E2%80%99s ability to fight%0A                  infections. Taking HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can make you/your child%0A                  more prone to getting infections or make any infection you/your child have%0A                  worse.WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS IN THIS MEDICATION?Medicinal ingredients: adalimumab injection Non-medicinal%0A                  ingredients: citric acid monohydrate, sodium citrate dihydrate, L-histidine, L-%0A                  histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sorbitol, polysorbate 20, water for%0A                  injectionTHIS MEDICATION COMES IN THE FOLLOWING DOSAGE FORMS:Single-use, 1 mL auto-injector containing 40 mg adalimumab injection%0A                    dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL)Single-use, 1 mL pre-filled glass syringe containing 40 mg adalimumab%0A                    injection dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL) All packaging components are latex-free.DO NOT USE THIS MEDICATION IF:You/your child should not take HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) if%0A                  you/your child have:an allergy to any of the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                    (see What are the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or%0A                      HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)? section).a serious infection such as tuberculosis, infections caused by bacteria or%0A                    fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread throughout the body%0A                    (sepsis).moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV).TO HELP AVOID SIDE EFFECTS AND ENSURE PROPER USE, TALK TO YOUR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS MEDICATION.

HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a%0A                  medicine that is used in:adults with rheumatoid arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints.adults with psoriatic arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints and skin.adults with ankylosing spondylitis, which is a form of arthritis.adults with Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    digestive tract.pediatrics with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who are 4 years%0A                    of age and older and require a full 40 mg dose based on body weight and%0A                    height.adults with ulcerative colitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    bowel (colon).adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) who have not%0A                    responded to antibiotics. HS is a painful, progressive, chronic inflammatory%0A                    skin disease that causes nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts and fistulas under the%0A                    breasts, underarms, buttocks and groin.adults with psoriasis, which is an inflammatory disease of the skin. The%0A                    doctor prescribed HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and%0A                    symptoms of your plaque psoriasis.adults with uveitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the eye. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic%0A                  arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, hidradenitis suppurativa,%0A                  psoriasis, or uveitis may be given other medicines for their disease before they%0A                  are given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM). If you have ulcerative colitis or%0A                  Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond%0A                  well enough to these medicines, you will be given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. HOW DOES THIS MEDICATION WORK?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a fully human monoclonal antibody%0A                  produced by cultured cells. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognize and%0A                  bind to other unique proteins. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) binds to a%0A                  specific protein called TNF- alpha (also known as tumor necrosis factor). People%0A                  with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease, ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa or psoriasis have too much%0A                  of TNF-alpha in their bodies. The extra TNF-alpha in your/your child%E2%80%99s body can%0A                  attack normal healthy body tissues and cause inflammation, especially in the%0A                  tissues of your /your child%E2%80%99s bones, cartilage, joints, digestive tract and skin.%0A                  By binding to TNF-alpha, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) decreases the%0A                  inflammation process of these diseases. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis,%0A                  polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis (such as pain%0A                  and swollen joints), may help improve your/your child%E2%80%99s ability to perform daily%0A                  activities (such as getting dressed, walking and climbing stairs), and may help%0A                  prevent further damage to your/your child%E2%80%99s bones and joints. In addition,%0A                  HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of%0A                  ankylosing spondylitis (back pain and morning stiffness), and adult Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease or ulcerative colitis (abdominal pain and diarrhea). HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is also used to treat inflammatory lesions (nodules and%0A                  abscesses) in adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) also helps reduce the signs and symptoms of psoriasis%0A                  (such as pain, itching and scaly patches on skin). HADLIMATM (or%0A                  HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps control uveitis by reducing the risk of inflammation%0A                  and loss of vision in adult patients. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM), however, can also lower your/your child%E2%80%99s body%E2%80%99s ability to fight%0A                  infections. Taking HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can make you/your child%0A                  more prone to getting infections or make any infection you/your child have%0A                  worse.WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS IN THIS MEDICATION?Medicinal ingredients: adalimumab injection Non-medicinal%0A                  ingredients: citric acid monohydrate, sodium citrate dihydrate, L-histidine, L-%0A                  histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sorbitol, polysorbate 20, water for%0A                  injectionTHIS MEDICATION COMES IN THE FOLLOWING DOSAGE FORMS:Single-use, 1 mL auto-injector containing 40 mg adalimumab injection%0A                    dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL)Single-use, 1 mL pre-filled glass syringe containing 40 mg adalimumab%0A                    injection dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL) All packaging components are latex-free.DO NOT USE THIS MEDICATION IF:You/your child should not take HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) if%0A                  you/your child have:an allergy to any of the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                    (see What are the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or%0A                      HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)? section).a serious infection such as tuberculosis, infections caused by bacteria or%0A                    fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread throughout the body%0A                    (sepsis).moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV).TO HELP AVOID SIDE EFFECTS AND ENSURE PROPER USE, TALK TO YOUR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS MEDICATION.

A%0A                  biosimilar is authorized based on its similarity to a reference biologic drug that%0A                  was already authorized for sale.Serious Warnings and PrecautionsBefore starting, during and after treatment with HADLIMATM (or%0A                          HADLIMATM PushTouchTM), you/your child should be checked for active or%0A                          inactive tuberculosis infection with a tuberculin skin test. Any medicine%0A                          can have side effects. Like all medicines that affect your/your child%E2%80%99s%0A                          immune system, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can cause serious side%0A                          effects. The possible serious side effects include:Allergic%0A                                reactions: If you/your child develop a severe%0A                            rash, swollen face or difficulty breathing while taking HADLIMATM (or%0A                            HADLIMATM PushTouchTM), call your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right away.%0A                          Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma: Very rare%0A                            reports of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare serious%0A                            lymphoma that is often fatal, have been identified in patients treated%0A                            with adalimumab injection. Most patients had also been treated with%0A                            other medications for Crohn%E2%80%99s disease and the majority were in%0A                            adolescent and young adult males. The link between HSTCL and adalimumab%0A                            injection is not clear.Other%0A                                cancers: There have been very rare cases of%0A                            certain kinds of cancer in patients taking adalimumab injection or other%0A                            TNF-blockers. Some patients receiving adalimumab injection have%0A                            developed types of cancer called non-melanoma skin cancer. Tell%0A                            your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor if you/your child have a bump or open sore that%0A                            does not heal. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have%0A                            had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of%0A                            getting a kind of cancer that affects the lymph system, called lymphoma.%0A                            If you/your child take HADLIMATM, HADLIMATM PushTouchTM, or other TNF-%0A                            blockers, your/your child%E2%80%99s risk may increase.

For children%0A                            and adults taking TNF-blocker medicines, the chances of developing%0A                            lymphoma or other cancers may increase.Lupus-like%0A                                symptoms: Some patients have developed%0A                            lupus-like symptoms that got better after their treatment was stopped.%0A                            If you/your child have chest pains that do not go away, shortness of%0A                            breath, joint pain or a rash on your/your child%E2%80%99s cheeks or arms that%0A                            gets worse in the sun, call your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right away.%0A                            Your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor may decide to stop your/your child%E2%80%99s%0A                            treatment.Nervous%0A                                system diseases: There have been rare cases of%0A                            disorders that affect the nervous system of people taking adalimumab%0A                            injection or other TNF-blockers. Signs that you/your child could be%0A                            experiencing a problem affecting your/your child%E2%80%99s nervous system%0A                            include: numbness or tingling, problems with your/your child%E2%80%99s vision,%0A                            weakness in your/your child%E2%80%99s legs, and dizziness.Serious%0A                                infections: There have been rare cases where%0A                            patients taking adalimumab injection or other TNF-blocking agents have%0A                            developed serious infections. Some of these cases have been%0A                            life-threatening. Such infections include tuberculosis, infections%0A                            caused by bacteria or fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread%0A                            throughout the body (sepsis). Infection causes include tuberculosis,%0A                            legionellosis (a serious form of bacterial pneumonia), listeriosis (an%0A                            infection that usually develops after eating food contaminated by%0A                            bacteria called listeria), and very rare cases of hepatitis B infection%0A                            relapse.Blood%0A                                problems: In some instances, patients treated%0A                            with TNF-blocking agents may develop low blood counts, such as anemia%0A                            (low red blood cells) or low platelets. If you/your child develop%0A                            symptoms such as persistent fever, bleeding, or bruising, you should%0A                            contact your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right awayWHAT IS THIS MEDICATION USED FOR?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) treatment should be started and%0A                  supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of%0A                  rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA),%0A                  psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), adult Crohn%E2%80%99s disease%0A                  (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), adult hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), psoriasis (Ps)%0A                  or adult uveitis, and familiar with the HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                  efficacy and safety profile. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a%0A                  medicine that is used in:adults with rheumatoid arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints.adults with psoriatic arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints and skin.adults with ankylosing spondylitis, which is a form of arthritis.adults with Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    digestive tract.pediatrics with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who are 4 years%0A                    of age and older and require a full 40 mg dose based on body weight and%0A                    height.adults with ulcerative colitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    bowel (colon).adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) who have not%0A                    responded to antibiotics. HS is a painful, progressive, chronic inflammatory%0A                    skin disease that causes nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts and fistulas under the%0A                    breasts, underarms, buttocks and groin.adults with psoriasis, which is an inflammatory disease of the skin. The%0A                    doctor prescribed HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and%0A                    symptoms of your plaque psoriasis.adults with uveitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the eye. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic%0A                  arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, hidradenitis suppurativa,%0A                  psoriasis, or uveitis may be given other medicines for their disease before they%0A                  are given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM). If you have ulcerative colitis or%0A                  Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond%0A                  well enough to these medicines, you will be given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. HOW DOES THIS MEDICATION WORK?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a fully human monoclonal antibody%0A                  produced by cultured cells. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognize and%0A                  bind to other unique proteins. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) binds to a%0A                  specific protein called TNF- alpha (also known as tumor necrosis factor). People%0A                  with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease, ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa or psoriasis have too much%0A                  of TNF-alpha in their bodies. The extra TNF-alpha in your/your child%E2%80%99s body can%0A                  attack normal healthy body tissues and cause inflammation, especially in the%0A                  tissues of your /your child%E2%80%99s bones, cartilage, joints, digestive tract and skin.%0A                  By binding to TNF-alpha, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) decreases the%0A                  inflammation process of these diseases. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis,%0A                  polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis (such as pain%0A                  and swollen joints), may help improve your/your child%E2%80%99s ability to perform daily%0A                  activities (such as getting dressed, walking and climbing stairs), and may help%0A                  prevent further damage to your/your child%E2%80%99s bones and joints. In addition,%0A                  HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of%0A                  ankylosing spondylitis (back pain and morning stiffness), and adult Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease or ulcerative colitis (abdominal pain and diarrhea). HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is also used to treat inflammatory lesions (nodules and%0A                  abscesses) in adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) also helps reduce the signs and symptoms of psoriasis%0A                  (such as pain, itching and scaly patches on skin). HADLIMATM (or%0A                  HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps control uveitis by reducing the risk of inflammation%0A                  and loss of vision in adult patients. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM), however, can also lower your/your child%E2%80%99s body%E2%80%99s ability to fight%0A                  infections. Taking HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can make you/your child%0A                  more prone to getting infections or make any infection you/your child have%0A                  worse.WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS IN THIS MEDICATION?Medicinal ingredients: adalimumab injection Non-medicinal%0A                  ingredients: citric acid monohydrate, sodium citrate dihydrate, L-histidine, L-%0A                  histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sorbitol, polysorbate 20, water for%0A                  injectionTHIS MEDICATION COMES IN THE FOLLOWING DOSAGE FORMS:Single-use, 1 mL auto-injector containing 40 mg adalimumab injection%0A                    dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL)Single-use, 1 mL pre-filled glass syringe containing 40 mg adalimumab%0A                    injection dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL) All packaging components are latex-free.DO NOT USE THIS MEDICATION IF:You/your child should not take HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) if%0A                  you/your child have:an allergy to any of the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                    (see What are the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or%0A                      HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)? section).a serious infection such as tuberculosis, infections caused by bacteria or%0A                    fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread throughout the body%0A                    (sepsis).moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV).TO HELP AVOID SIDE EFFECTS AND ENSURE PROPER USE, TALK TO YOUR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS MEDICATION.

Any medicine%0A                          can have side effects. Like all medicines that affect your/your child%E2%80%99s%0A                          immune system, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can cause serious side%0A                          effects. The possible serious side effects include:Allergic%0A                                reactions: If you/your child develop a severe%0A                            rash, swollen face or difficulty breathing while taking HADLIMATM (or%0A                            HADLIMATM PushTouchTM), call your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right away.%0A                          Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma: Very rare%0A                            reports of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare serious%0A                            lymphoma that is often fatal, have been identified in patients treated%0A                            with adalimumab injection. Most patients had also been treated with%0A                            other medications for Crohn%E2%80%99s disease and the majority were in%0A                            adolescent and young adult males. The link between HSTCL and adalimumab%0A                            injection is not clear.Other%0A                                cancers: There have been very rare cases of%0A                            certain kinds of cancer in patients taking adalimumab injection or other%0A                            TNF-blockers. Some patients receiving adalimumab injection have%0A                            developed types of cancer called non-melanoma skin cancer. Tell%0A                            your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor if you/your child have a bump or open sore that%0A                            does not heal. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have%0A                            had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of%0A                            getting a kind of cancer that affects the lymph system, called lymphoma.%0A                            If you/your child take HADLIMATM, HADLIMATM PushTouchTM, or other TNF-%0A                            blockers, your/your child%E2%80%99s risk may increase. There have been cases of%0A                            lymphoma and other cancers, including unusual types, in children,%0A                            adolescents and young adults taking TNF-blocking agents, including%0A                            adalimumab injection, which sometimes resulted in death. For children%0A                            and adults taking TNF-blocker medicines, the chances of developing%0A                            lymphoma or other cancers may increase.Lupus-like%0A                                symptoms: Some patients have developed%0A                            lupus-like symptoms that got better after their treatment was stopped.%0A                            If you/your child have chest pains that do not go away, shortness of%0A                            breath, joint pain or a rash on your/your child%E2%80%99s cheeks or arms that%0A                            gets worse in the sun, call your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right away.%0A                            Your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor may decide to stop your/your child%E2%80%99s%0A                            treatment.Nervous%0A                                system diseases: There have been rare cases of%0A                            disorders that affect the nervous system of people taking adalimumab%0A                            injection or other TNF-blockers.

Some of these cases have been%0A                            life-threatening. Such infections include tuberculosis, infections%0A                            caused by bacteria or fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread%0A                            throughout the body (sepsis). Infection causes include tuberculosis,%0A                            legionellosis (a serious form of bacterial pneumonia), listeriosis (an%0A                            infection that usually develops after eating food contaminated by%0A                            bacteria called listeria), and very rare cases of hepatitis B infection%0A                            relapse.Blood%0A                                problems: In some instances, patients treated%0A                            with TNF-blocking agents may develop low blood counts, such as anemia%0A                            (low red blood cells) or low platelets. If you/your child develop%0A                            symptoms such as persistent fever, bleeding, or bruising, you should%0A                            contact your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right awayWHAT IS THIS MEDICATION USED FOR?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) treatment should be started and%0A                  supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of%0A                  rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA),%0A                  psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), adult Crohn%E2%80%99s disease%0A                  (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), adult hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), psoriasis (Ps)%0A                  or adult uveitis, and familiar with the HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                  efficacy and safety profile. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a%0A                  medicine that is used in:adults with rheumatoid arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints.adults with psoriatic arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints and skin.adults with ankylosing spondylitis, which is a form of arthritis.adults with Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    digestive tract.pediatrics with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who are 4 years%0A                    of age and older and require a full 40 mg dose based on body weight and%0A                    height.adults with ulcerative colitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    bowel (colon).adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) who have not%0A                    responded to antibiotics. HS is a painful, progressive, chronic inflammatory%0A                    skin disease that causes nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts and fistulas under the%0A                    breasts, underarms, buttocks and groin.adults with psoriasis, which is an inflammatory disease of the skin. The%0A                    doctor prescribed HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and%0A                    symptoms of your plaque psoriasis.adults with uveitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the eye. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic%0A                  arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, hidradenitis suppurativa,%0A                  psoriasis, or uveitis may be given other medicines for their disease before they%0A                  are given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM). If you have ulcerative colitis or%0A                  Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond%0A                  well enough to these medicines, you will be given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. HOW DOES THIS MEDICATION WORK?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a fully human monoclonal antibody%0A                  produced by cultured cells. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognize and%0A                  bind to other unique proteins. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) binds to a%0A                  specific protein called TNF- alpha (also known as tumor necrosis factor). People%0A                  with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease, ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa or psoriasis have too much%0A                  of TNF-alpha in their bodies. The extra TNF-alpha in your/your child%E2%80%99s body can%0A                  attack normal healthy body tissues and cause inflammation, especially in the%0A                  tissues of your /your child%E2%80%99s bones, cartilage, joints, digestive tract and skin.%0A                  By binding to TNF-alpha, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) decreases the%0A                  inflammation process of these diseases. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis,%0A                  polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis (such as pain%0A                  and swollen joints), may help improve your/your child%E2%80%99s ability to perform daily%0A                  activities (such as getting dressed, walking and climbing stairs), and may help%0A                  prevent further damage to your/your child%E2%80%99s bones and joints. In addition,%0A                  HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of%0A                  ankylosing spondylitis (back pain and morning stiffness), and adult Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease or ulcerative colitis (abdominal pain and diarrhea). HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is also used to treat inflammatory lesions (nodules and%0A                  abscesses) in adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) also helps reduce the signs and symptoms of psoriasis%0A                  (such as pain, itching and scaly patches on skin). HADLIMATM (or%0A                  HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps control uveitis by reducing the risk of inflammation%0A                  and loss of vision in adult patients. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM), however, can also lower your/your child%E2%80%99s body%E2%80%99s ability to fight%0A                  infections. Taking HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can make you/your child%0A                  more prone to getting infections or make any infection you/your child have%0A                  worse.WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS IN THIS MEDICATION?Medicinal ingredients: adalimumab injection Non-medicinal%0A                  ingredients: citric acid monohydrate, sodium citrate dihydrate, L-histidine, L-%0A                  histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sorbitol, polysorbate 20, water for%0A                  injectionTHIS MEDICATION COMES IN THE FOLLOWING DOSAGE FORMS:Single-use, 1 mL auto-injector containing 40 mg adalimumab injection%0A                    dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL)Single-use, 1 mL pre-filled glass syringe containing 40 mg adalimumab%0A                    injection dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL) All packaging components are latex-free.DO NOT USE THIS MEDICATION IF:You/your child should not take HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) if%0A                  you/your child have:an allergy to any of the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                    (see What are the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or%0A                      HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)? section).a serious infection such as tuberculosis, infections caused by bacteria or%0A                    fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread throughout the body%0A                    (sepsis).moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV).TO HELP AVOID SIDE EFFECTS AND ENSURE PROPER USE, TALK TO YOUR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS MEDICATION.

Like all medicines that affect your/your child%E2%80%99s%0A                          immune system, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can cause serious side%0A                          effects. The possible serious side effects include:Allergic%0A                                reactions: If you/your child develop a severe%0A                            rash, swollen face or difficulty breathing while taking HADLIMATM (or%0A                            HADLIMATM PushTouchTM), call your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right away.%0A                          Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma: Very rare%0A                            reports of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare serious%0A                            lymphoma that is often fatal, have been identified in patients treated%0A                            with adalimumab injection. Most patients had also been treated with%0A                            other medications for Crohn%E2%80%99s disease and the majority were in%0A                            adolescent and young adult males. The link between HSTCL and adalimumab%0A                            injection is not clear.Other%0A                                cancers: There have been very rare cases of%0A                            certain kinds of cancer in patients taking adalimumab injection or other%0A                            TNF-blockers. Some patients receiving adalimumab injection have%0A                            developed types of cancer called non-melanoma skin cancer. Tell%0A                            your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor if you/your child have a bump or open sore that%0A                            does not heal. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have%0A                            had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of%0A                            getting a kind of cancer that affects the lymph system, called lymphoma.%0A                            If you/your child take HADLIMATM, HADLIMATM PushTouchTM, or other TNF-%0A                            blockers, your/your child%E2%80%99s risk may increase. There have been cases of%0A                            lymphoma and other cancers, including unusual types, in children,%0A                            adolescents and young adults taking TNF-blocking agents, including%0A                            adalimumab injection, which sometimes resulted in death. For children%0A                            and adults taking TNF-blocker medicines, the chances of developing%0A                            lymphoma or other cancers may increase.Lupus-like%0A                                symptoms: Some patients have developed%0A                            lupus-like symptoms that got better after their treatment was stopped.%0A                            If you/your child have chest pains that do not go away, shortness of%0A                            breath, joint pain or a rash on your/your child%E2%80%99s cheeks or arms that%0A                            gets worse in the sun, call your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right away.%0A                            Your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor may decide to stop your/your child%E2%80%99s%0A                            treatment.Nervous%0A                                system diseases: There have been rare cases of%0A                            disorders that affect the nervous system of people taking adalimumab%0A                            injection or other TNF-blockers.

Some of these cases have been%0A                            life-threatening. Such infections include tuberculosis, infections%0A                            caused by bacteria or fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread%0A                            throughout the body (sepsis). Infection causes include tuberculosis,%0A                            legionellosis (a serious form of bacterial pneumonia), listeriosis (an%0A                            infection that usually develops after eating food contaminated by%0A                            bacteria called listeria), and very rare cases of hepatitis B infection%0A                            relapse.Blood%0A                                problems: In some instances, patients treated%0A                            with TNF-blocking agents may develop low blood counts, such as anemia%0A                            (low red blood cells) or low platelets. If you/your child develop%0A                            symptoms such as persistent fever, bleeding, or bruising, you should%0A                            contact your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right awayWHAT IS THIS MEDICATION USED FOR?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) treatment should be started and%0A                  supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of%0A                  rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA),%0A                  psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), adult Crohn%E2%80%99s disease%0A                  (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), adult hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), psoriasis (Ps)%0A                  or adult uveitis, and familiar with the HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                  efficacy and safety profile. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a%0A                  medicine that is used in:adults with rheumatoid arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints.adults with psoriatic arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints and skin.adults with ankylosing spondylitis, which is a form of arthritis.adults with Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    digestive tract.pediatrics with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who are 4 years%0A                    of age and older and require a full 40 mg dose based on body weight and%0A                    height.adults with ulcerative colitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    bowel (colon).adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) who have not%0A                    responded to antibiotics. HS is a painful, progressive, chronic inflammatory%0A                    skin disease that causes nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts and fistulas under the%0A                    breasts, underarms, buttocks and groin.adults with psoriasis, which is an inflammatory disease of the skin. The%0A                    doctor prescribed HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and%0A                    symptoms of your plaque psoriasis.adults with uveitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the eye. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic%0A                  arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, hidradenitis suppurativa,%0A                  psoriasis, or uveitis may be given other medicines for their disease before they%0A                  are given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM). If you have ulcerative colitis or%0A                  Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond%0A                  well enough to these medicines, you will be given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. HOW DOES THIS MEDICATION WORK?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a fully human monoclonal antibody%0A                  produced by cultured cells. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognize and%0A                  bind to other unique proteins. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) binds to a%0A                  specific protein called TNF- alpha (also known as tumor necrosis factor). People%0A                  with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease, ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa or psoriasis have too much%0A                  of TNF-alpha in their bodies. The extra TNF-alpha in your/your child%E2%80%99s body can%0A                  attack normal healthy body tissues and cause inflammation, especially in the%0A                  tissues of your /your child%E2%80%99s bones, cartilage, joints, digestive tract and skin.%0A                  By binding to TNF-alpha, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) decreases the%0A                  inflammation process of these diseases. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis,%0A                  polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis (such as pain%0A                  and swollen joints), may help improve your/your child%E2%80%99s ability to perform daily%0A                  activities (such as getting dressed, walking and climbing stairs), and may help%0A                  prevent further damage to your/your child%E2%80%99s bones and joints. In addition,%0A                  HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of%0A                  ankylosing spondylitis (back pain and morning stiffness), and adult Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease or ulcerative colitis (abdominal pain and diarrhea). HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is also used to treat inflammatory lesions (nodules and%0A                  abscesses) in adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) also helps reduce the signs and symptoms of psoriasis%0A                  (such as pain, itching and scaly patches on skin). HADLIMATM (or%0A                  HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps control uveitis by reducing the risk of inflammation%0A                  and loss of vision in adult patients. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM), however, can also lower your/your child%E2%80%99s body%E2%80%99s ability to fight%0A                  infections. Taking HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can make you/your child%0A                  more prone to getting infections or make any infection you/your child have%0A                  worse.WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS IN THIS MEDICATION?Medicinal ingredients: adalimumab injection Non-medicinal%0A                  ingredients: citric acid monohydrate, sodium citrate dihydrate, L-histidine, L-%0A                  histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sorbitol, polysorbate 20, water for%0A                  injectionTHIS MEDICATION COMES IN THE FOLLOWING DOSAGE FORMS:Single-use, 1 mL auto-injector containing 40 mg adalimumab injection%0A                    dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL)Single-use, 1 mL pre-filled glass syringe containing 40 mg adalimumab%0A                    injection dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL) All packaging components are latex-free.DO NOT USE THIS MEDICATION IF:You/your child should not take HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) if%0A                  you/your child have:an allergy to any of the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                    (see What are the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or%0A                      HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)? section).a serious infection such as tuberculosis, infections caused by bacteria or%0A                    fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread throughout the body%0A                    (sepsis).moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV).TO HELP AVOID SIDE EFFECTS AND ENSURE PROPER USE, TALK TO YOUR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS MEDICATION.

Like all medicines that affect your/your child%E2%80%99s%0A                          immune system, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can cause serious side%0A                          effects. The possible serious side effects include:Allergic%0A                                reactions: If you/your child develop a severe%0A                            rash, swollen face or difficulty breathing while taking HADLIMATM (or%0A                            HADLIMATM PushTouchTM), call your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right away.%0A                          Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma: Very rare%0A                            reports of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare serious%0A                            lymphoma that is often fatal, have been identified in patients treated%0A                            with adalimumab injection. Most patients had also been treated with%0A                            other medications for Crohn%E2%80%99s disease and the majority were in%0A                            adolescent and young adult males. The link between HSTCL and adalimumab%0A                            injection is not clear.Other%0A                                cancers: There have been very rare cases of%0A                            certain kinds of cancer in patients taking adalimumab injection or other%0A                            TNF-blockers. Some patients receiving adalimumab injection have%0A                            developed types of cancer called non-melanoma skin cancer. Tell%0A                            your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor if you/your child have a bump or open sore that%0A                            does not heal. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have%0A                            had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of%0A                            getting a kind of cancer that affects the lymph system, called lymphoma.%0A                            If you/your child take HADLIMATM, HADLIMATM PushTouchTM, or other TNF-%0A                            blockers, your/your child%E2%80%99s risk may increase.

Some of these cases have been%0A                            life-threatening. Such infections include tuberculosis, infections%0A                            caused by bacteria or fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread%0A                            throughout the body (sepsis). Infection causes include tuberculosis,%0A                            legionellosis (a serious form of bacterial pneumonia), listeriosis (an%0A                            infection that usually develops after eating food contaminated by%0A                            bacteria called listeria), and very rare cases of hepatitis B infection%0A                            relapse.Blood%0A                                problems: In some instances, patients treated%0A                            with TNF-blocking agents may develop low blood counts, such as anemia%0A                            (low red blood cells) or low platelets. If you/your child develop%0A                            symptoms such as persistent fever, bleeding, or bruising, you should%0A                            contact your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right awayWHAT IS THIS MEDICATION USED FOR?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) treatment should be started and%0A                  supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of%0A                  rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA),%0A                  psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), adult Crohn%E2%80%99s disease%0A                  (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), adult hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), psoriasis (Ps)%0A                  or adult uveitis, and familiar with the HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                  efficacy and safety profile. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a%0A                  medicine that is used in:adults with rheumatoid arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints.adults with psoriatic arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints and skin.adults with ankylosing spondylitis, which is a form of arthritis.adults with Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    digestive tract.pediatrics with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who are 4 years%0A                    of age and older and require a full 40 mg dose based on body weight and%0A                    height.adults with ulcerative colitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    bowel (colon).adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) who have not%0A                    responded to antibiotics. HS is a painful, progressive, chronic inflammatory%0A                    skin disease that causes nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts and fistulas under the%0A                    breasts, underarms, buttocks and groin.adults with psoriasis, which is an inflammatory disease of the skin. The%0A                    doctor prescribed HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and%0A                    symptoms of your plaque psoriasis.adults with uveitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the eye. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic%0A                  arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, hidradenitis suppurativa,%0A                  psoriasis, or uveitis may be given other medicines for their disease before they%0A                  are given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM). If you have ulcerative colitis or%0A                  Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond%0A                  well enough to these medicines, you will be given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. HOW DOES THIS MEDICATION WORK?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a fully human monoclonal antibody%0A                  produced by cultured cells. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognize and%0A                  bind to other unique proteins. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) binds to a%0A                  specific protein called TNF- alpha (also known as tumor necrosis factor). People%0A                  with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease, ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa or psoriasis have too much%0A                  of TNF-alpha in their bodies. The extra TNF-alpha in your/your child%E2%80%99s body can%0A                  attack normal healthy body tissues and cause inflammation, especially in the%0A                  tissues of your /your child%E2%80%99s bones, cartilage, joints, digestive tract and skin.%0A                  By binding to TNF-alpha, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) decreases the%0A                  inflammation process of these diseases. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis,%0A                  polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis (such as pain%0A                  and swollen joints), may help improve your/your child%E2%80%99s ability to perform daily%0A                  activities (such as getting dressed, walking and climbing stairs), and may help%0A                  prevent further damage to your/your child%E2%80%99s bones and joints. In addition,%0A                  HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of%0A                  ankylosing spondylitis (back pain and morning stiffness), and adult Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease or ulcerative colitis (abdominal pain and diarrhea). HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is also used to treat inflammatory lesions (nodules and%0A                  abscesses) in adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa.

The possible serious side effects include:Allergic%0A                                reactions: If you/your child develop a severe%0A                            rash, swollen face or difficulty breathing while taking HADLIMATM (or%0A                            HADLIMATM PushTouchTM), call your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right away.%0A                          Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma: Very rare%0A                            reports of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare serious%0A                            lymphoma that is often fatal, have been identified in patients treated%0A                            with adalimumab injection. Most patients had also been treated with%0A                            other medications for Crohn%E2%80%99s disease and the majority were in%0A                            adolescent and young adult males. The link between HSTCL and adalimumab%0A                            injection is not clear.Other%0A                                cancers: There have been very rare cases of%0A                            certain kinds of cancer in patients taking adalimumab injection or other%0A                            TNF-blockers. Some patients receiving adalimumab injection have%0A                            developed types of cancer called non-melanoma skin cancer. Tell%0A                            your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor if you/your child have a bump or open sore that%0A                            does not heal. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have%0A                            had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of%0A                            getting a kind of cancer that affects the lymph system, called lymphoma.%0A                            If you/your child take HADLIMATM, HADLIMATM PushTouchTM, or other TNF-%0A                            blockers, your/your child%E2%80%99s risk may increase. There have been cases of%0A                            lymphoma and other cancers, including unusual types, in children,%0A                            adolescents and young adults taking TNF-blocking agents, including%0A                            adalimumab injection, which sometimes resulted in death. For children%0A                            and adults taking TNF-blocker medicines, the chances of developing%0A                            lymphoma or other cancers may increase.Lupus-like%0A                                symptoms: Some patients have developed%0A                            lupus-like symptoms that got better after their treatment was stopped.%0A                            If you/your child have chest pains that do not go away, shortness of%0A                            breath, joint pain or a rash on your/your child%E2%80%99s cheeks or arms that%0A                            gets worse in the sun, call your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right away.%0A                            Your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor may decide to stop your/your child%E2%80%99s%0A                            treatment.Nervous%0A                                system diseases: There have been rare cases of%0A                            disorders that affect the nervous system of people taking adalimumab%0A                            injection or other TNF-blockers. Signs that you/your child could be%0A                            experiencing a problem affecting your/your child%E2%80%99s nervous system%0A                            include: numbness or tingling, problems with your/your child%E2%80%99s vision,%0A                            weakness in your/your child%E2%80%99s legs, and dizziness.Serious%0A                                infections: There have been rare cases where%0A                            patients taking adalimumab injection or other TNF-blocking agents have%0A                            developed serious infections. Some of these cases have been%0A                            life-threatening. Such infections include tuberculosis, infections%0A                            caused by bacteria or fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread%0A                            throughout the body (sepsis). Infection causes include tuberculosis,%0A                            legionellosis (a serious form of bacterial pneumonia), listeriosis (an%0A                            infection that usually develops after eating food contaminated by%0A                            bacteria called listeria), and very rare cases of hepatitis B infection%0A                            relapse.Blood%0A                                problems: In some instances, patients treated%0A                            with TNF-blocking agents may develop low blood counts, such as anemia%0A                            (low red blood cells) or low platelets. If you/your child develop%0A                            symptoms such as persistent fever, bleeding, or bruising, you should%0A                            contact your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right awayWHAT IS THIS MEDICATION USED FOR?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) treatment should be started and%0A                  supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of%0A                  rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA),%0A                  psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), adult Crohn%E2%80%99s disease%0A                  (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), adult hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), psoriasis (Ps)%0A                  or adult uveitis, and familiar with the HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                  efficacy and safety profile. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a%0A                  medicine that is used in:adults with rheumatoid arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints.adults with psoriatic arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints and skin.adults with ankylosing spondylitis, which is a form of arthritis.adults with Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    digestive tract.pediatrics with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who are 4 years%0A                    of age and older and require a full 40 mg dose based on body weight and%0A                    height.adults with ulcerative colitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    bowel (colon).adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) who have not%0A                    responded to antibiotics. HS is a painful, progressive, chronic inflammatory%0A                    skin disease that causes nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts and fistulas under the%0A                    breasts, underarms, buttocks and groin.adults with psoriasis, which is an inflammatory disease of the skin. The%0A                    doctor prescribed HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and%0A                    symptoms of your plaque psoriasis.adults with uveitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the eye. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic%0A                  arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, hidradenitis suppurativa,%0A                  psoriasis, or uveitis may be given other medicines for their disease before they%0A                  are given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM). If you have ulcerative colitis or%0A                  Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond%0A                  well enough to these medicines, you will be given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. HOW DOES THIS MEDICATION WORK?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a fully human monoclonal antibody%0A                  produced by cultured cells. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognize and%0A                  bind to other unique proteins. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) binds to a%0A                  specific protein called TNF- alpha (also known as tumor necrosis factor). People%0A                  with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease, ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa or psoriasis have too much%0A                  of TNF-alpha in their bodies. The extra TNF-alpha in your/your child%E2%80%99s body can%0A                  attack normal healthy body tissues and cause inflammation, especially in the%0A                  tissues of your /your child%E2%80%99s bones, cartilage, joints, digestive tract and skin.%0A                  By binding to TNF-alpha, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) decreases the%0A                  inflammation process of these diseases. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis,%0A                  polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis (such as pain%0A                  and swollen joints), may help improve your/your child%E2%80%99s ability to perform daily%0A                  activities (such as getting dressed, walking and climbing stairs), and may help%0A                  prevent further damage to your/your child%E2%80%99s bones and joints. In addition,%0A                  HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of%0A                  ankylosing spondylitis (back pain and morning stiffness), and adult Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease or ulcerative colitis (abdominal pain and diarrhea). HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is also used to treat inflammatory lesions (nodules and%0A                  abscesses) in adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) also helps reduce the signs and symptoms of psoriasis%0A                  (such as pain, itching and scaly patches on skin). HADLIMATM (or%0A                  HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps control uveitis by reducing the risk of inflammation%0A                  and loss of vision in adult patients. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM), however, can also lower your/your child%E2%80%99s body%E2%80%99s ability to fight%0A                  infections. Taking HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can make you/your child%0A                  more prone to getting infections or make any infection you/your child have%0A                  worse.WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS IN THIS MEDICATION?Medicinal ingredients: adalimumab injection Non-medicinal%0A                  ingredients: citric acid monohydrate, sodium citrate dihydrate, L-histidine, L-%0A                  histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sorbitol, polysorbate 20, water for%0A                  injectionTHIS MEDICATION COMES IN THE FOLLOWING DOSAGE FORMS:Single-use, 1 mL auto-injector containing 40 mg adalimumab injection%0A                    dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL)Single-use, 1 mL pre-filled glass syringe containing 40 mg adalimumab%0A                    injection dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL) All packaging components are latex-free.DO NOT USE THIS MEDICATION IF:You/your child should not take HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) if%0A                  you/your child have:an allergy to any of the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                    (see What are the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or%0A                      HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)? section).a serious infection such as tuberculosis, infections caused by bacteria or%0A                    fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread throughout the body%0A                    (sepsis).moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV).TO HELP AVOID SIDE EFFECTS AND ENSURE PROPER USE, TALK TO YOUR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS MEDICATION.

Like all medicines that affect your/your child%E2%80%99s%0A                          immune system, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can cause serious side%0A                          effects. The possible serious side effects include:Allergic%0A                                reactions: If you/your child develop a severe%0A                            rash, swollen face or difficulty breathing while taking HADLIMATM (or%0A                            HADLIMATM PushTouchTM), call your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right away.%0A                          Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma: Very rare%0A                            reports of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare serious%0A                            lymphoma that is often fatal, have been identified in patients treated%0A                            with adalimumab injection. Most patients had also been treated with%0A                            other medications for Crohn%E2%80%99s disease and the majority were in%0A                            adolescent and young adult males. The link between HSTCL and adalimumab%0A                            injection is not clear.Other%0A                                cancers: There have been very rare cases of%0A                            certain kinds of cancer in patients taking adalimumab injection or other%0A                            TNF-blockers. Some patients receiving adalimumab injection have%0A                            developed types of cancer called non-melanoma skin cancer. Tell%0A                            your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor if you/your child have a bump or open sore that%0A                            does not heal. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have%0A                            had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of%0A                            getting a kind of cancer that affects the lymph system, called lymphoma.%0A                            If you/your child take HADLIMATM, HADLIMATM PushTouchTM, or other TNF-%0A                            blockers, your/your child%E2%80%99s risk may increase.

Some of these cases have been%0A                            life-threatening. Such infections include tuberculosis, infections%0A                            caused by bacteria or fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread%0A                            throughout the body (sepsis). Infection causes include tuberculosis,%0A                            legionellosis (a serious form of bacterial pneumonia), listeriosis (an%0A                            infection that usually develops after eating food contaminated by%0A                            bacteria called listeria), and very rare cases of hepatitis B infection%0A                            relapse.Blood%0A                                problems: In some instances, patients treated%0A                            with TNF-blocking agents may develop low blood counts, such as anemia%0A                            (low red blood cells) or low platelets. If you/your child develop%0A                            symptoms such as persistent fever, bleeding, or bruising, you should%0A                            contact your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right awayWHAT IS THIS MEDICATION USED FOR?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) treatment should be started and%0A                  supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of%0A                  rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA),%0A                  psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), adult Crohn%E2%80%99s disease%0A                  (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), adult hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), psoriasis (Ps)%0A                  or adult uveitis, and familiar with the HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                  efficacy and safety profile. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a%0A                  medicine that is used in:adults with rheumatoid arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints.adults with psoriatic arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints and skin.adults with ankylosing spondylitis, which is a form of arthritis.adults with Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    digestive tract.pediatrics with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who are 4 years%0A                    of age and older and require a full 40 mg dose based on body weight and%0A                    height.adults with ulcerative colitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    bowel (colon).adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) who have not%0A                    responded to antibiotics. HS is a painful, progressive, chronic inflammatory%0A                    skin disease that causes nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts and fistulas under the%0A                    breasts, underarms, buttocks and groin.adults with psoriasis, which is an inflammatory disease of the skin. The%0A                    doctor prescribed HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and%0A                    symptoms of your plaque psoriasis.adults with uveitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the eye. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic%0A                  arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, hidradenitis suppurativa,%0A                  psoriasis, or uveitis may be given other medicines for their disease before they%0A                  are given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM). If you have ulcerative colitis or%0A                  Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond%0A                  well enough to these medicines, you will be given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. HOW DOES THIS MEDICATION WORK?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a fully human monoclonal antibody%0A                  produced by cultured cells. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognize and%0A                  bind to other unique proteins. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) binds to a%0A                  specific protein called TNF- alpha (also known as tumor necrosis factor). People%0A                  with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease, ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa or psoriasis have too much%0A                  of TNF-alpha in their bodies. The extra TNF-alpha in your/your child%E2%80%99s body can%0A                  attack normal healthy body tissues and cause inflammation, especially in the%0A                  tissues of your /your child%E2%80%99s bones, cartilage, joints, digestive tract and skin.%0A                  By binding to TNF-alpha, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) decreases the%0A                  inflammation process of these diseases. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis,%0A                  polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis (such as pain%0A                  and swollen joints), may help improve your/your child%E2%80%99s ability to perform daily%0A                  activities (such as getting dressed, walking and climbing stairs), and may help%0A                  prevent further damage to your/your child%E2%80%99s bones and joints. In addition,%0A                  HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of%0A                  ankylosing spondylitis (back pain and morning stiffness), and adult Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease or ulcerative colitis (abdominal pain and diarrhea). HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is also used to treat inflammatory lesions (nodules and%0A                  abscesses) in adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) also helps reduce the signs and symptoms of psoriasis%0A                  (such as pain, itching and scaly patches on skin). HADLIMATM (or%0A                  HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps control uveitis by reducing the risk of inflammation%0A                  and loss of vision in adult patients. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM), however, can also lower your/your child%E2%80%99s body%E2%80%99s ability to fight%0A                  infections. Taking HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can make you/your child%0A                  more prone to getting infections or make any infection you/your child have%0A                  worse.WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS IN THIS MEDICATION?Medicinal ingredients: adalimumab injection Non-medicinal%0A                  ingredients: citric acid monohydrate, sodium citrate dihydrate, L-histidine, L-%0A                  histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sorbitol, polysorbate 20, water for%0A                  injectionTHIS MEDICATION COMES IN THE FOLLOWING DOSAGE FORMS:Single-use, 1 mL auto-injector containing 40 mg adalimumab injection%0A                    dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL)Single-use, 1 mL pre-filled glass syringe containing 40 mg adalimumab%0A                    injection dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL) All packaging components are latex-free.DO NOT USE THIS MEDICATION IF:You/your child should not take HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) if%0A                  you/your child have:an allergy to any of the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                    (see What are the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or%0A                      HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)? section).a serious infection such as tuberculosis, infections caused by bacteria or%0A                    fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread throughout the body%0A                    (sepsis).moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV).TO HELP AVOID SIDE EFFECTS AND ENSURE PROPER USE, TALK TO YOUR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS MEDICATION.

Any medicine%0A                          can have side effects. Like all medicines that affect your/your child%E2%80%99s%0A                          immune system, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can cause serious side%0A                          effects. The possible serious side effects include:Allergic%0A                                reactions: If you/your child develop a severe%0A                            rash, swollen face or difficulty breathing while taking HADLIMATM (or%0A                            HADLIMATM PushTouchTM), call your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right away.%0A                          Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma: Very rare%0A                            reports of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare serious%0A                            lymphoma that is often fatal, have been identified in patients treated%0A                            with adalimumab injection. Most patients had also been treated with%0A                            other medications for Crohn%E2%80%99s disease and the majority were in%0A                            adolescent and young adult males. The link between HSTCL and adalimumab%0A                            injection is not clear.Other%0A                                cancers: There have been very rare cases of%0A                            certain kinds of cancer in patients taking adalimumab injection or other%0A                            TNF-blockers. Some patients receiving adalimumab injection have%0A                            developed types of cancer called non-melanoma skin cancer. Tell%0A                            your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor if you/your child have a bump or open sore that%0A                            does not heal. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have%0A                            had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of%0A                            getting a kind of cancer that affects the lymph system, called lymphoma.%0A                            If you/your child take HADLIMATM, HADLIMATM PushTouchTM, or other TNF-%0A                            blockers, your/your child%E2%80%99s risk may increase. There have been cases of%0A                            lymphoma and other cancers, including unusual types, in children,%0A                            adolescents and young adults taking TNF-blocking agents, including%0A                            adalimumab injection, which sometimes resulted in death. For children%0A                            and adults taking TNF-blocker medicines, the chances of developing%0A                            lymphoma or other cancers may increase.Lupus-like%0A                                symptoms: Some patients have developed%0A                            lupus-like symptoms that got better after their treatment was stopped.%0A                            If you/your child have chest pains that do not go away, shortness of%0A                            breath, joint pain or a rash on your/your child%E2%80%99s cheeks or arms that%0A                            gets worse in the sun, call your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right away.%0A                            Your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor may decide to stop your/your child%E2%80%99s%0A                            treatment.Nervous%0A                                system diseases: There have been rare cases of%0A                            disorders that affect the nervous system of people taking adalimumab%0A                            injection or other TNF-blockers.

Some of these cases have been%0A                            life-threatening. Such infections include tuberculosis, infections%0A                            caused by bacteria or fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread%0A                            throughout the body (sepsis). Infection causes include tuberculosis,%0A                            legionellosis (a serious form of bacterial pneumonia), listeriosis (an%0A                            infection that usually develops after eating food contaminated by%0A                            bacteria called listeria), and very rare cases of hepatitis B infection%0A                            relapse.Blood%0A                                problems: In some instances, patients treated%0A                            with TNF-blocking agents may develop low blood counts, such as anemia%0A                            (low red blood cells) or low platelets. If you/your child develop%0A                            symptoms such as persistent fever, bleeding, or bruising, you should%0A                            contact your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right awayWHAT IS THIS MEDICATION USED FOR?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) treatment should be started and%0A                  supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of%0A                  rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA),%0A                  psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), adult Crohn%E2%80%99s disease%0A                  (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), adult hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), psoriasis (Ps)%0A                  or adult uveitis, and familiar with the HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                  efficacy and safety profile. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a%0A                  medicine that is used in:adults with rheumatoid arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints.adults with psoriatic arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints and skin.adults with ankylosing spondylitis, which is a form of arthritis.adults with Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    digestive tract.pediatrics with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who are 4 years%0A                    of age and older and require a full 40 mg dose based on body weight and%0A                    height.adults with ulcerative colitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    bowel (colon).adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) who have not%0A                    responded to antibiotics. HS is a painful, progressive, chronic inflammatory%0A                    skin disease that causes nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts and fistulas under the%0A                    breasts, underarms, buttocks and groin.adults with psoriasis, which is an inflammatory disease of the skin. The%0A                    doctor prescribed HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and%0A                    symptoms of your plaque psoriasis.adults with uveitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the eye. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic%0A                  arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, hidradenitis suppurativa,%0A                  psoriasis, or uveitis may be given other medicines for their disease before they%0A                  are given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM). If you have ulcerative colitis or%0A                  Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond%0A                  well enough to these medicines, you will be given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. HOW DOES THIS MEDICATION WORK?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a fully human monoclonal antibody%0A                  produced by cultured cells. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognize and%0A                  bind to other unique proteins. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) binds to a%0A                  specific protein called TNF- alpha (also known as tumor necrosis factor). People%0A                  with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease, ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa or psoriasis have too much%0A                  of TNF-alpha in their bodies. The extra TNF-alpha in your/your child%E2%80%99s body can%0A                  attack normal healthy body tissues and cause inflammation, especially in the%0A                  tissues of your /your child%E2%80%99s bones, cartilage, joints, digestive tract and skin.%0A                  By binding to TNF-alpha, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) decreases the%0A                  inflammation process of these diseases. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis,%0A                  polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis (such as pain%0A                  and swollen joints), may help improve your/your child%E2%80%99s ability to perform daily%0A                  activities (such as getting dressed, walking and climbing stairs), and may help%0A                  prevent further damage to your/your child%E2%80%99s bones and joints. In addition,%0A                  HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of%0A                  ankylosing spondylitis (back pain and morning stiffness), and adult Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease or ulcerative colitis (abdominal pain and diarrhea). HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is also used to treat inflammatory lesions (nodules and%0A                  abscesses) in adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) also helps reduce the signs and symptoms of psoriasis%0A                  (such as pain, itching and scaly patches on skin). HADLIMATM (or%0A                  HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps control uveitis by reducing the risk of inflammation%0A                  and loss of vision in adult patients. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM), however, can also lower your/your child%E2%80%99s body%E2%80%99s ability to fight%0A                  infections. Taking HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can make you/your child%0A                  more prone to getting infections or make any infection you/your child have%0A                  worse.WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS IN THIS MEDICATION?Medicinal ingredients: adalimumab injection Non-medicinal%0A                  ingredients: citric acid monohydrate, sodium citrate dihydrate, L-histidine, L-%0A                  histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sorbitol, polysorbate 20, water for%0A                  injectionTHIS MEDICATION COMES IN THE FOLLOWING DOSAGE FORMS:Single-use, 1 mL auto-injector containing 40 mg adalimumab injection%0A                    dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL)Single-use, 1 mL pre-filled glass syringe containing 40 mg adalimumab%0A                    injection dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL) All packaging components are latex-free.DO NOT USE THIS MEDICATION IF:You/your child should not take HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) if%0A                  you/your child have:an allergy to any of the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                    (see What are the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or%0A                      HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)? section).a serious infection such as tuberculosis, infections caused by bacteria or%0A                    fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread throughout the body%0A                    (sepsis).moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV).TO HELP AVOID SIDE EFFECTS AND ENSURE PROPER USE, TALK TO YOUR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS MEDICATION.

Any medicine%0A                          can have side effects. Like all medicines that affect your/your child%E2%80%99s%0A                          immune system, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can cause serious side%0A                          effects. The possible serious side effects include:Allergic%0A                                reactions: If you/your child develop a severe%0A                            rash, swollen face or difficulty breathing while taking HADLIMATM (or%0A                            HADLIMATM PushTouchTM), call your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right away.%0A                          Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma: Very rare%0A                            reports of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare serious%0A                            lymphoma that is often fatal, have been identified in patients treated%0A                            with adalimumab injection. Most patients had also been treated with%0A                            other medications for Crohn%E2%80%99s disease and the majority were in%0A                            adolescent and young adult males. The link between HSTCL and adalimumab%0A                            injection is not clear.Other%0A                                cancers: There have been very rare cases of%0A                            certain kinds of cancer in patients taking adalimumab injection or other%0A                            TNF-blockers. Some patients receiving adalimumab injection have%0A                            developed types of cancer called non-melanoma skin cancer. Tell%0A                            your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor if you/your child have a bump or open sore that%0A                            does not heal. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have%0A                            had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of%0A                            getting a kind of cancer that affects the lymph system, called lymphoma.%0A                            If you/your child take HADLIMATM, HADLIMATM PushTouchTM, or other TNF-%0A                            blockers, your/your child%E2%80%99s risk may increase. There have been cases of%0A                            lymphoma and other cancers, including unusual types, in children,%0A                            adolescents and young adults taking TNF-blocking agents, including%0A                            adalimumab injection, which sometimes resulted in death. For children%0A                            and adults taking TNF-blocker medicines, the chances of developing%0A                            lymphoma or other cancers may increase.Lupus-like%0A                                symptoms: Some patients have developed%0A                            lupus-like symptoms that got better after their treatment was stopped.%0A                            If you/your child have chest pains that do not go away, shortness of%0A                            breath, joint pain or a rash on your/your child%E2%80%99s cheeks or arms that%0A                            gets worse in the sun, call your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right away.%0A                            Your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor may decide to stop your/your child%E2%80%99s%0A                            treatment.Nervous%0A                                system diseases: There have been rare cases of%0A                            disorders that affect the nervous system of people taking adalimumab%0A                            injection or other TNF-blockers.

Some of these cases have been%0A                            life-threatening. Such infections include tuberculosis, infections%0A                            caused by bacteria or fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread%0A                            throughout the body (sepsis). Infection causes include tuberculosis,%0A                            legionellosis (a serious form of bacterial pneumonia), listeriosis (an%0A                            infection that usually develops after eating food contaminated by%0A                            bacteria called listeria), and very rare cases of hepatitis B infection%0A                            relapse.Blood%0A                                problems: In some instances, patients treated%0A                            with TNF-blocking agents may develop low blood counts, such as anemia%0A                            (low red blood cells) or low platelets. If you/your child develop%0A                            symptoms such as persistent fever, bleeding, or bruising, you should%0A                            contact your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right awayWHAT IS THIS MEDICATION USED FOR?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) treatment should be started and%0A                  supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of%0A                  rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA),%0A                  psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), adult Crohn%E2%80%99s disease%0A                  (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), adult hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), psoriasis (Ps)%0A                  or adult uveitis, and familiar with the HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                  efficacy and safety profile. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a%0A                  medicine that is used in:adults with rheumatoid arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints.adults with psoriatic arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints and skin.adults with ankylosing spondylitis, which is a form of arthritis.adults with Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    digestive tract.pediatrics with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who are 4 years%0A                    of age and older and require a full 40 mg dose based on body weight and%0A                    height.adults with ulcerative colitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    bowel (colon).adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) who have not%0A                    responded to antibiotics. HS is a painful, progressive, chronic inflammatory%0A                    skin disease that causes nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts and fistulas under the%0A                    breasts, underarms, buttocks and groin.adults with psoriasis, which is an inflammatory disease of the skin. The%0A                    doctor prescribed HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and%0A                    symptoms of your plaque psoriasis.adults with uveitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the eye. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic%0A                  arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, hidradenitis suppurativa,%0A                  psoriasis, or uveitis may be given other medicines for their disease before they%0A                  are given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM). If you have ulcerative colitis or%0A                  Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond%0A                  well enough to these medicines, you will be given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. HOW DOES THIS MEDICATION WORK?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a fully human monoclonal antibody%0A                  produced by cultured cells. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognize and%0A                  bind to other unique proteins. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) binds to a%0A                  specific protein called TNF- alpha (also known as tumor necrosis factor). People%0A                  with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease, ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa or psoriasis have too much%0A                  of TNF-alpha in their bodies. The extra TNF-alpha in your/your child%E2%80%99s body can%0A                  attack normal healthy body tissues and cause inflammation, especially in the%0A                  tissues of your /your child%E2%80%99s bones, cartilage, joints, digestive tract and skin.%0A                  By binding to TNF-alpha, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) decreases the%0A                  inflammation process of these diseases. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis,%0A                  polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis (such as pain%0A                  and swollen joints), may help improve your/your child%E2%80%99s ability to perform daily%0A                  activities (such as getting dressed, walking and climbing stairs), and may help%0A                  prevent further damage to your/your child%E2%80%99s bones and joints. In addition,%0A                  HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of%0A                  ankylosing spondylitis (back pain and morning stiffness), and adult Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease or ulcerative colitis (abdominal pain and diarrhea). HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is also used to treat inflammatory lesions (nodules and%0A                  abscesses) in adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) also helps reduce the signs and symptoms of psoriasis%0A                  (such as pain, itching and scaly patches on skin). HADLIMATM (or%0A                  HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps control uveitis by reducing the risk of inflammation%0A                  and loss of vision in adult patients. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM), however, can also lower your/your child%E2%80%99s body%E2%80%99s ability to fight%0A                  infections. Taking HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can make you/your child%0A                  more prone to getting infections or make any infection you/your child have%0A                  worse.WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS IN THIS MEDICATION?Medicinal ingredients: adalimumab injection Non-medicinal%0A                  ingredients: citric acid monohydrate, sodium citrate dihydrate, L-histidine, L-%0A                  histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sorbitol, polysorbate 20, water for%0A                  injectionTHIS MEDICATION COMES IN THE FOLLOWING DOSAGE FORMS:Single-use, 1 mL auto-injector containing 40 mg adalimumab injection%0A                    dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL)Single-use, 1 mL pre-filled glass syringe containing 40 mg adalimumab%0A                    injection dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL) All packaging components are latex-free.DO NOT USE THIS MEDICATION IF:You/your child should not take HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) if%0A                  you/your child have:an allergy to any of the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                    (see What are the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or%0A                      HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)? section).a serious infection such as tuberculosis, infections caused by bacteria or%0A                    fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread throughout the body%0A                    (sepsis).moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV).TO HELP AVOID SIDE EFFECTS AND ENSURE PROPER USE, TALK TO YOUR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS MEDICATION.

Like all medicines that affect your/your child%E2%80%99s%0A                          immune system, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can cause serious side%0A                          effects. The possible serious side effects include:Allergic%0A                                reactions: If you/your child develop a severe%0A                            rash, swollen face or difficulty breathing while taking HADLIMATM (or%0A                            HADLIMATM PushTouchTM), call your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right away.%0A                          Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma: Very rare%0A                            reports of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare serious%0A                            lymphoma that is often fatal, have been identified in patients treated%0A                            with adalimumab injection. Most patients had also been treated with%0A                            other medications for Crohn%E2%80%99s disease and the majority were in%0A                            adolescent and young adult males. The link between HSTCL and adalimumab%0A                            injection is not clear.Other%0A                                cancers: There have been very rare cases of%0A                            certain kinds of cancer in patients taking adalimumab injection or other%0A                            TNF-blockers. Some patients receiving adalimumab injection have%0A                            developed types of cancer called non-melanoma skin cancer. Tell%0A                            your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor if you/your child have a bump or open sore that%0A                            does not heal. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have%0A                            had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of%0A                            getting a kind of cancer that affects the lymph system, called lymphoma.%0A                            If you/your child take HADLIMATM, HADLIMATM PushTouchTM, or other TNF-%0A                            blockers, your/your child%E2%80%99s risk may increase. There have been cases of%0A                            lymphoma and other cancers, including unusual types, in children,%0A                            adolescents and young adults taking TNF-blocking agents, including%0A                            adalimumab injection, which sometimes resulted in death. For children%0A                            and adults taking TNF-blocker medicines, the chances of developing%0A                            lymphoma or other cancers may increase.Lupus-like%0A                                symptoms: Some patients have developed%0A                            lupus-like symptoms that got better after their treatment was stopped.%0A                            If you/your child have chest pains that do not go away, shortness of%0A                            breath, joint pain or a rash on your/your child%E2%80%99s cheeks or arms that%0A                            gets worse in the sun, call your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right away.%0A                            Your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor may decide to stop your/your child%E2%80%99s%0A                            treatment.Nervous%0A                                system diseases: There have been rare cases of%0A                            disorders that affect the nervous system of people taking adalimumab%0A                            injection or other TNF-blockers.

Some of these cases have been%0A                            life-threatening. Such infections include tuberculosis, infections%0A                            caused by bacteria or fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread%0A                            throughout the body (sepsis). Infection causes include tuberculosis,%0A                            legionellosis (a serious form of bacterial pneumonia), listeriosis (an%0A                            infection that usually develops after eating food contaminated by%0A                            bacteria called listeria), and very rare cases of hepatitis B infection%0A                            relapse.Blood%0A                                problems: In some instances, patients treated%0A                            with TNF-blocking agents may develop low blood counts, such as anemia%0A                            (low red blood cells) or low platelets. If you/your child develop%0A                            symptoms such as persistent fever, bleeding, or bruising, you should%0A                            contact your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right awayWHAT IS THIS MEDICATION USED FOR?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) treatment should be started and%0A                  supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of%0A                  rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA),%0A                  psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), adult Crohn%E2%80%99s disease%0A                  (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), adult hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), psoriasis (Ps)%0A                  or adult uveitis, and familiar with the HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                  efficacy and safety profile. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a%0A                  medicine that is used in:adults with rheumatoid arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints.adults with psoriatic arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints and skin.adults with ankylosing spondylitis, which is a form of arthritis.adults with Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    digestive tract.pediatrics with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who are 4 years%0A                    of age and older and require a full 40 mg dose based on body weight and%0A                    height.adults with ulcerative colitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    bowel (colon).adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) who have not%0A                    responded to antibiotics. HS is a painful, progressive, chronic inflammatory%0A                    skin disease that causes nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts and fistulas under the%0A                    breasts, underarms, buttocks and groin.adults with psoriasis, which is an inflammatory disease of the skin. The%0A                    doctor prescribed HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and%0A                    symptoms of your plaque psoriasis.adults with uveitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the eye. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic%0A                  arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, hidradenitis suppurativa,%0A                  psoriasis, or uveitis may be given other medicines for their disease before they%0A                  are given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM). If you have ulcerative colitis or%0A                  Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond%0A                  well enough to these medicines, you will be given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. HOW DOES THIS MEDICATION WORK?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a fully human monoclonal antibody%0A                  produced by cultured cells. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognize and%0A                  bind to other unique proteins. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) binds to a%0A                  specific protein called TNF- alpha (also known as tumor necrosis factor). People%0A                  with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease, ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa or psoriasis have too much%0A                  of TNF-alpha in their bodies. The extra TNF-alpha in your/your child%E2%80%99s body can%0A                  attack normal healthy body tissues and cause inflammation, especially in the%0A                  tissues of your /your child%E2%80%99s bones, cartilage, joints, digestive tract and skin.%0A                  By binding to TNF-alpha, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) decreases the%0A                  inflammation process of these diseases. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis,%0A                  polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis (such as pain%0A                  and swollen joints), may help improve your/your child%E2%80%99s ability to perform daily%0A                  activities (such as getting dressed, walking and climbing stairs), and may help%0A                  prevent further damage to your/your child%E2%80%99s bones and joints. In addition,%0A                  HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of%0A                  ankylosing spondylitis (back pain and morning stiffness), and adult Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease or ulcerative colitis (abdominal pain and diarrhea). HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is also used to treat inflammatory lesions (nodules and%0A                  abscesses) in adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) also helps reduce the signs and symptoms of psoriasis%0A                  (such as pain, itching and scaly patches on skin). HADLIMATM (or%0A                  HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps control uveitis by reducing the risk of inflammation%0A                  and loss of vision in adult patients. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM), however, can also lower your/your child%E2%80%99s body%E2%80%99s ability to fight%0A                  infections. Taking HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can make you/your child%0A                  more prone to getting infections or make any infection you/your child have%0A                  worse.WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS IN THIS MEDICATION?Medicinal ingredients: adalimumab injection Non-medicinal%0A                  ingredients: citric acid monohydrate, sodium citrate dihydrate, L-histidine, L-%0A                  histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sorbitol, polysorbate 20, water for%0A                  injectionTHIS MEDICATION COMES IN THE FOLLOWING DOSAGE FORMS:Single-use, 1 mL auto-injector containing 40 mg adalimumab injection%0A                    dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL)Single-use, 1 mL pre-filled glass syringe containing 40 mg adalimumab%0A                    injection dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL) All packaging components are latex-free.DO NOT USE THIS MEDICATION IF:You/your child should not take HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) if%0A                  you/your child have:an allergy to any of the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                    (see What are the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or%0A                      HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)? section).a serious infection such as tuberculosis, infections caused by bacteria or%0A                    fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread throughout the body%0A                    (sepsis).moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV).TO HELP AVOID SIDE EFFECTS AND ENSURE PROPER USE, TALK TO YOUR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS MEDICATION.

Like all medicines that affect your/your child%E2%80%99s%0A                          immune system, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can cause serious side%0A                          effects. The possible serious side effects include:Allergic%0A                                reactions: If you/your child develop a severe%0A                            rash, swollen face or difficulty breathing while taking HADLIMATM (or%0A                            HADLIMATM PushTouchTM), call your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right away.%0A                          Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma: Very rare%0A                            reports of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare serious%0A                            lymphoma that is often fatal, have been identified in patients treated%0A                            with adalimumab injection. Most patients had also been treated with%0A                            other medications for Crohn%E2%80%99s disease and the majority were in%0A                            adolescent and young adult males. The link between HSTCL and adalimumab%0A                            injection is not clear.Other%0A                                cancers: There have been very rare cases of%0A                            certain kinds of cancer in patients taking adalimumab injection or other%0A                            TNF-blockers. Some patients receiving adalimumab injection have%0A                            developed types of cancer called non-melanoma skin cancer. Tell%0A                            your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor if you/your child have a bump or open sore that%0A                            does not heal. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have%0A                            had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of%0A                            getting a kind of cancer that affects the lymph system, called lymphoma.%0A                            If you/your child take HADLIMATM, HADLIMATM PushTouchTM, or other TNF-%0A                            blockers, your/your child%E2%80%99s risk may increase. There have been cases of%0A                            lymphoma and other cancers, including unusual types, in children,%0A                            adolescents and young adults taking TNF-blocking agents, including%0A                            adalimumab injection, which sometimes resulted in death. For children%0A                            and adults taking TNF-blocker medicines, the chances of developing%0A                            lymphoma or other cancers may increase.Lupus-like%0A                                symptoms: Some patients have developed%0A                            lupus-like symptoms that got better after their treatment was stopped.%0A                            If you/your child have chest pains that do not go away, shortness of%0A                            breath, joint pain or a rash on your/your child%E2%80%99s cheeks or arms that%0A                            gets worse in the sun, call your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right away.%0A                            Your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor may decide to stop your/your child%E2%80%99s%0A                            treatment.Nervous%0A                                system diseases: There have been rare cases of%0A                            disorders that affect the nervous system of people taking adalimumab%0A                            injection or other TNF-blockers.

Some of these cases have been%0A                            life-threatening. Such infections include tuberculosis, infections%0A                            caused by bacteria or fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread%0A                            throughout the body (sepsis). Infection causes include tuberculosis,%0A                            legionellosis (a serious form of bacterial pneumonia), listeriosis (an%0A                            infection that usually develops after eating food contaminated by%0A                            bacteria called listeria), and very rare cases of hepatitis B infection%0A                            relapse.Blood%0A                                problems: In some instances, patients treated%0A                            with TNF-blocking agents may develop low blood counts, such as anemia%0A                            (low red blood cells) or low platelets. If you/your child develop%0A                            symptoms such as persistent fever, bleeding, or bruising, you should%0A                            contact your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right awayWHAT IS THIS MEDICATION USED FOR?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) treatment should be started and%0A                  supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of%0A                  rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA),%0A                  psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), adult Crohn%E2%80%99s disease%0A                  (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), adult hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), psoriasis (Ps)%0A                  or adult uveitis, and familiar with the HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                  efficacy and safety profile. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a%0A                  medicine that is used in:adults with rheumatoid arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints.adults with psoriatic arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints and skin.adults with ankylosing spondylitis, which is a form of arthritis.adults with Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    digestive tract.pediatrics with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who are 4 years%0A                    of age and older and require a full 40 mg dose based on body weight and%0A                    height.adults with ulcerative colitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    bowel (colon).adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) who have not%0A                    responded to antibiotics. HS is a painful, progressive, chronic inflammatory%0A                    skin disease that causes nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts and fistulas under the%0A                    breasts, underarms, buttocks and groin.adults with psoriasis, which is an inflammatory disease of the skin. The%0A                    doctor prescribed HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and%0A                    symptoms of your plaque psoriasis.adults with uveitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the eye. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic%0A                  arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, hidradenitis suppurativa,%0A                  psoriasis, or uveitis may be given other medicines for their disease before they%0A                  are given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM). If you have ulcerative colitis or%0A                  Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond%0A                  well enough to these medicines, you will be given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. HOW DOES THIS MEDICATION WORK?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a fully human monoclonal antibody%0A                  produced by cultured cells. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognize and%0A                  bind to other unique proteins. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) binds to a%0A                  specific protein called TNF- alpha (also known as tumor necrosis factor). People%0A                  with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease, ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa or psoriasis have too much%0A                  of TNF-alpha in their bodies. The extra TNF-alpha in your/your child%E2%80%99s body can%0A                  attack normal healthy body tissues and cause inflammation, especially in the%0A                  tissues of your /your child%E2%80%99s bones, cartilage, joints, digestive tract and skin.%0A                  By binding to TNF-alpha, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) decreases the%0A                  inflammation process of these diseases. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis,%0A                  polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis (such as pain%0A                  and swollen joints), may help improve your/your child%E2%80%99s ability to perform daily%0A                  activities (such as getting dressed, walking and climbing stairs), and may help%0A                  prevent further damage to your/your child%E2%80%99s bones and joints. In addition,%0A                  HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of%0A                  ankylosing spondylitis (back pain and morning stiffness), and adult Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease or ulcerative colitis (abdominal pain and diarrhea). HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is also used to treat inflammatory lesions (nodules and%0A                  abscesses) in adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) also helps reduce the signs and symptoms of psoriasis%0A                  (such as pain, itching and scaly patches on skin). HADLIMATM (or%0A                  HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps control uveitis by reducing the risk of inflammation%0A                  and loss of vision in adult patients. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM), however, can also lower your/your child%E2%80%99s body%E2%80%99s ability to fight%0A                  infections.

Most patients had also been treated with%0A                            other medications for Crohn%E2%80%99s disease and the majority were in%0A                            adolescent and young adult males. The link between HSTCL and adalimumab%0A                            injection is not clear.Other%0A                                cancers: There have been very rare cases of%0A                            certain kinds of cancer in patients taking adalimumab injection or other%0A                            TNF-blockers. Some patients receiving adalimumab injection have%0A                            developed types of cancer called non-melanoma skin cancer. Tell%0A                            your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor if you/your child have a bump or open sore that%0A                            does not heal. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have%0A                            had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of%0A                            getting a kind of cancer that affects the lymph system, called lymphoma.%0A                            If you/your child take HADLIMATM, HADLIMATM PushTouchTM, or other TNF-%0A                            blockers, your/your child%E2%80%99s risk may increase.

Some of these cases have been%0A                            life-threatening. Such infections include tuberculosis, infections%0A                            caused by bacteria or fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread%0A                            throughout the body (sepsis). Infection causes include tuberculosis,%0A                            legionellosis (a serious form of bacterial pneumonia), listeriosis (an%0A                            infection that usually develops after eating food contaminated by%0A                            bacteria called listeria), and very rare cases of hepatitis B infection%0A                            relapse.Blood%0A                                problems: In some instances, patients treated%0A                            with TNF-blocking agents may develop low blood counts, such as anemia%0A                            (low red blood cells) or low platelets. If you/your child develop%0A                            symptoms such as persistent fever, bleeding, or bruising, you should%0A                            contact your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right awayWHAT IS THIS MEDICATION USED FOR?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) treatment should be started and%0A                  supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of%0A                  rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA),%0A                  psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), adult Crohn%E2%80%99s disease%0A                  (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), adult hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), psoriasis (Ps)%0A                  or adult uveitis, and familiar with the HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                  efficacy and safety profile. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a%0A                  medicine that is used in:adults with rheumatoid arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints.adults with psoriatic arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints and skin.adults with ankylosing spondylitis, which is a form of arthritis.adults with Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    digestive tract.pediatrics with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who are 4 years%0A                    of age and older and require a full 40 mg dose based on body weight and%0A                    height.adults with ulcerative colitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    bowel (colon).adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) who have not%0A                    responded to antibiotics. HS is a painful, progressive, chronic inflammatory%0A                    skin disease that causes nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts and fistulas under the%0A                    breasts, underarms, buttocks and groin.adults with psoriasis, which is an inflammatory disease of the skin. The%0A                    doctor prescribed HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and%0A                    symptoms of your plaque psoriasis.adults with uveitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the eye. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic%0A                  arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, hidradenitis suppurativa,%0A                  psoriasis, or uveitis may be given other medicines for their disease before they%0A                  are given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM). If you have ulcerative colitis or%0A                  Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond%0A                  well enough to these medicines, you will be given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. HOW DOES THIS MEDICATION WORK?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a fully human monoclonal antibody%0A                  produced by cultured cells. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognize and%0A                  bind to other unique proteins. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) binds to a%0A                  specific protein called TNF- alpha (also known as tumor necrosis factor). People%0A                  with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease, ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa or psoriasis have too much%0A                  of TNF-alpha in their bodies. The extra TNF-alpha in your/your child%E2%80%99s body can%0A                  attack normal healthy body tissues and cause inflammation, especially in the%0A                  tissues of your /your child%E2%80%99s bones, cartilage, joints, digestive tract and skin.%0A                  By binding to TNF-alpha, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) decreases the%0A                  inflammation process of these diseases. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis,%0A                  polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis (such as pain%0A                  and swollen joints), may help improve your/your child%E2%80%99s ability to perform daily%0A                  activities (such as getting dressed, walking and climbing stairs), and may help%0A                  prevent further damage to your/your child%E2%80%99s bones and joints. In addition,%0A                  HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of%0A                  ankylosing spondylitis (back pain and morning stiffness), and adult Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease or ulcerative colitis (abdominal pain and diarrhea). HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is also used to treat inflammatory lesions (nodules and%0A                  abscesses) in adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) also helps reduce the signs and symptoms of psoriasis%0A                  (such as pain, itching and scaly patches on skin).

Most patients had also been treated with%0A                            other medications for Crohn%E2%80%99s disease and the majority were in%0A                            adolescent and young adult males. The link between HSTCL and adalimumab%0A                            injection is not clear.Other%0A                                cancers: There have been very rare cases of%0A                            certain kinds of cancer in patients taking adalimumab injection or other%0A                            TNF-blockers. Some patients receiving adalimumab injection have%0A                            developed types of cancer called non-melanoma skin cancer. Tell%0A                            your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor if you/your child have a bump or open sore that%0A                            does not heal. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have%0A                            had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of%0A                            getting a kind of cancer that affects the lymph system, called lymphoma.%0A                            If you/your child take HADLIMATM, HADLIMATM PushTouchTM, or other TNF-%0A                            blockers, your/your child%E2%80%99s risk may increase.

Some of these cases have been%0A                            life-threatening. Such infections include tuberculosis, infections%0A                            caused by bacteria or fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread%0A                            throughout the body (sepsis). Infection causes include tuberculosis,%0A                            legionellosis (a serious form of bacterial pneumonia), listeriosis (an%0A                            infection that usually develops after eating food contaminated by%0A                            bacteria called listeria), and very rare cases of hepatitis B infection%0A                            relapse.Blood%0A                                problems: In some instances, patients treated%0A                            with TNF-blocking agents may develop low blood counts, such as anemia%0A                            (low red blood cells) or low platelets. If you/your child develop%0A                            symptoms such as persistent fever, bleeding, or bruising, you should%0A                            contact your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right awayWHAT IS THIS MEDICATION USED FOR?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) treatment should be started and%0A                  supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of%0A                  rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA),%0A                  psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), adult Crohn%E2%80%99s disease%0A                  (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), adult hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), psoriasis (Ps)%0A                  or adult uveitis, and familiar with the HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                  efficacy and safety profile. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a%0A                  medicine that is used in:adults with rheumatoid arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints.adults with psoriatic arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints and skin.adults with ankylosing spondylitis, which is a form of arthritis.adults with Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    digestive tract.pediatrics with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who are 4 years%0A                    of age and older and require a full 40 mg dose based on body weight and%0A                    height.adults with ulcerative colitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    bowel (colon).adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) who have not%0A                    responded to antibiotics. HS is a painful, progressive, chronic inflammatory%0A                    skin disease that causes nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts and fistulas under the%0A                    breasts, underarms, buttocks and groin.adults with psoriasis, which is an inflammatory disease of the skin. The%0A                    doctor prescribed HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and%0A                    symptoms of your plaque psoriasis.adults with uveitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the eye. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic%0A                  arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, hidradenitis suppurativa,%0A                  psoriasis, or uveitis may be given other medicines for their disease before they%0A                  are given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM). If you have ulcerative colitis or%0A                  Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond%0A                  well enough to these medicines, you will be given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. HOW DOES THIS MEDICATION WORK?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a fully human monoclonal antibody%0A                  produced by cultured cells. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognize and%0A                  bind to other unique proteins. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) binds to a%0A                  specific protein called TNF- alpha (also known as tumor necrosis factor). People%0A                  with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease, ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa or psoriasis have too much%0A                  of TNF-alpha in their bodies. The extra TNF-alpha in your/your child%E2%80%99s body can%0A                  attack normal healthy body tissues and cause inflammation, especially in the%0A                  tissues of your /your child%E2%80%99s bones, cartilage, joints, digestive tract and skin.%0A                  By binding to TNF-alpha, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) decreases the%0A                  inflammation process of these diseases. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis,%0A                  polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis (such as pain%0A                  and swollen joints), may help improve your/your child%E2%80%99s ability to perform daily%0A                  activities (such as getting dressed, walking and climbing stairs), and may help%0A                  prevent further damage to your/your child%E2%80%99s bones and joints. In addition,%0A                  HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of%0A                  ankylosing spondylitis (back pain and morning stiffness), and adult Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease or ulcerative colitis (abdominal pain and diarrhea). HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is also used to treat inflammatory lesions (nodules and%0A                  abscesses) in adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) also helps reduce the signs and symptoms of psoriasis%0A                  (such as pain, itching and scaly patches on skin). HADLIMATM (or%0A                  HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps control uveitis by reducing the risk of inflammation%0A                  and loss of vision in adult patients. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM), however, can also lower your/your child%E2%80%99s body%E2%80%99s ability to fight%0A                  infections. Taking HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can make you/your child%0A                  more prone to getting infections or make any infection you/your child have%0A                  worse.WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS IN THIS MEDICATION?Medicinal ingredients: adalimumab injection Non-medicinal%0A                  ingredients: citric acid monohydrate, sodium citrate dihydrate, L-histidine, L-%0A                  histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sorbitol, polysorbate 20, water for%0A                  injectionTHIS MEDICATION COMES IN THE FOLLOWING DOSAGE FORMS:Single-use, 1 mL auto-injector containing 40 mg adalimumab injection%0A                    dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL)Single-use, 1 mL pre-filled glass syringe containing 40 mg adalimumab%0A                    injection dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL) All packaging components are latex-free.DO NOT USE THIS MEDICATION IF:You/your child should not take HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) if%0A                  you/your child have:an allergy to any of the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                    (see What are the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or%0A                      HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)? section).a serious infection such as tuberculosis, infections caused by bacteria or%0A                    fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread throughout the body%0A                    (sepsis).moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV).TO HELP AVOID SIDE EFFECTS AND ENSURE PROPER USE, TALK TO YOUR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS MEDICATION.

If you do not respond%0A                  well enough to these medicines, you will be given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. HOW DOES THIS MEDICATION WORK?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a fully human monoclonal antibody%0A                  produced by cultured cells. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognize and%0A                  bind to other unique proteins. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) binds to a%0A                  specific protein called TNF- alpha (also known as tumor necrosis factor). People%0A                  with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease, ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa or psoriasis have too much%0A                  of TNF-alpha in their bodies. The extra TNF-alpha in your/your child%E2%80%99s body can%0A                  attack normal healthy body tissues and cause inflammation, especially in the%0A                  tissues of your /your child%E2%80%99s bones, cartilage, joints, digestive tract and skin.%0A                  By binding to TNF-alpha, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) decreases the%0A                  inflammation process of these diseases. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis,%0A                  polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis (such as pain%0A                  and swollen joints), may help improve your/your child%E2%80%99s ability to perform daily%0A                  activities (such as getting dressed, walking and climbing stairs), and may help%0A                  prevent further damage to your/your child%E2%80%99s bones and joints. In addition,%0A                  HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of%0A                  ankylosing spondylitis (back pain and morning stiffness), and adult Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease or ulcerative colitis (abdominal pain and diarrhea). HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is also used to treat inflammatory lesions (nodules and%0A                  abscesses) in adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) also helps reduce the signs and symptoms of psoriasis%0A                  (such as pain, itching and scaly patches on skin). HADLIMATM (or%0A                  HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps control uveitis by reducing the risk of inflammation%0A                  and loss of vision in adult patients. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM), however, can also lower your/your child%E2%80%99s body%E2%80%99s ability to fight%0A                  infections. Taking HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can make you/your child%0A                  more prone to getting infections or make any infection you/your child have%0A                  worse.WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS IN THIS MEDICATION?Medicinal ingredients: adalimumab injection Non-medicinal%0A                  ingredients: citric acid monohydrate, sodium citrate dihydrate, L-histidine, L-%0A                  histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sorbitol, polysorbate 20, water for%0A                  injectionTHIS MEDICATION COMES IN THE FOLLOWING DOSAGE FORMS:Single-use, 1 mL auto-injector containing 40 mg adalimumab injection%0A                    dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL)Single-use, 1 mL pre-filled glass syringe containing 40 mg adalimumab%0A                    injection dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL) All packaging components are latex-free.DO NOT USE THIS MEDICATION IF:You/your child should not take HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) if%0A                  you/your child have:an allergy to any of the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                    (see What are the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or%0A                      HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)? section).a serious infection such as tuberculosis, infections caused by bacteria or%0A                    fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread throughout the body%0A                    (sepsis).moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV).TO HELP AVOID SIDE EFFECTS AND ENSURE PROPER USE, TALK TO YOUR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS MEDICATION.

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic%0A                  arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, hidradenitis suppurativa,%0A                  psoriasis, or uveitis may be given other medicines for their disease before they%0A                  are given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM). If you have ulcerative colitis or%0A                  Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond%0A                  well enough to these medicines, you will be given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. HOW DOES THIS MEDICATION WORK?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a fully human monoclonal antibody%0A                  produced by cultured cells. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognize and%0A                  bind to other unique proteins. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) binds to a%0A                  specific protein called TNF- alpha (also known as tumor necrosis factor). People%0A                  with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease, ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa or psoriasis have too much%0A                  of TNF-alpha in their bodies. The extra TNF-alpha in your/your child%E2%80%99s body can%0A                  attack normal healthy body tissues and cause inflammation, especially in the%0A                  tissues of your /your child%E2%80%99s bones, cartilage, joints, digestive tract and skin.%0A                  By binding to TNF-alpha, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) decreases the%0A                  inflammation process of these diseases. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis,%0A                  polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis (such as pain%0A                  and swollen joints), may help improve your/your child%E2%80%99s ability to perform daily%0A                  activities (such as getting dressed, walking and climbing stairs), and may help%0A                  prevent further damage to your/your child%E2%80%99s bones and joints. In addition,%0A                  HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of%0A                  ankylosing spondylitis (back pain and morning stiffness), and adult Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease or ulcerative colitis (abdominal pain and diarrhea). HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is also used to treat inflammatory lesions (nodules and%0A                  abscesses) in adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) also helps reduce the signs and symptoms of psoriasis%0A                  (such as pain, itching and scaly patches on skin). HADLIMATM (or%0A                  HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps control uveitis by reducing the risk of inflammation%0A                  and loss of vision in adult patients. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM), however, can also lower your/your child%E2%80%99s body%E2%80%99s ability to fight%0A                  infections. Taking HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can make you/your child%0A                  more prone to getting infections or make any infection you/your child have%0A                  worse.WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS IN THIS MEDICATION?Medicinal ingredients: adalimumab injection Non-medicinal%0A                  ingredients: citric acid monohydrate, sodium citrate dihydrate, L-histidine, L-%0A                  histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sorbitol, polysorbate 20, water for%0A                  injectionTHIS MEDICATION COMES IN THE FOLLOWING DOSAGE FORMS:Single-use, 1 mL auto-injector containing 40 mg adalimumab injection%0A                    dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL)Single-use, 1 mL pre-filled glass syringe containing 40 mg adalimumab%0A                    injection dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL) All packaging components are latex-free.DO NOT USE THIS MEDICATION IF:You/your child should not take HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) if%0A                  you/your child have:an allergy to any of the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                    (see What are the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or%0A                      HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)? section).a serious infection such as tuberculosis, infections caused by bacteria or%0A                    fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread throughout the body%0A                    (sepsis).moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV).TO HELP AVOID SIDE EFFECTS AND ENSURE PROPER USE, TALK TO YOUR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS MEDICATION.

HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a%0A                  medicine that is used in:adults with rheumatoid arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints.adults with psoriatic arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints and skin.adults with ankylosing spondylitis, which is a form of arthritis.adults with Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    digestive tract.pediatrics with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who are 4 years%0A                    of age and older and require a full 40 mg dose based on body weight and%0A                    height.adults with ulcerative colitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    bowel (colon).adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) who have not%0A                    responded to antibiotics. HS is a painful, progressive, chronic inflammatory%0A                    skin disease that causes nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts and fistulas under the%0A                    breasts, underarms, buttocks and groin.adults with psoriasis, which is an inflammatory disease of the skin. The%0A                    doctor prescribed HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and%0A                    symptoms of your plaque psoriasis.adults with uveitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the eye. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic%0A                  arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, hidradenitis suppurativa,%0A                  psoriasis, or uveitis may be given other medicines for their disease before they%0A                  are given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM). If you have ulcerative colitis or%0A                  Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond%0A                  well enough to these medicines, you will be given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. HOW DOES THIS MEDICATION WORK?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a fully human monoclonal antibody%0A                  produced by cultured cells. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognize and%0A                  bind to other unique proteins. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) binds to a%0A                  specific protein called TNF- alpha (also known as tumor necrosis factor). People%0A                  with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease, ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa or psoriasis have too much%0A                  of TNF-alpha in their bodies. The extra TNF-alpha in your/your child%E2%80%99s body can%0A                  attack normal healthy body tissues and cause inflammation, especially in the%0A                  tissues of your /your child%E2%80%99s bones, cartilage, joints, digestive tract and skin.%0A                  By binding to TNF-alpha, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) decreases the%0A                  inflammation process of these diseases. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis,%0A                  polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis (such as pain%0A                  and swollen joints), may help improve your/your child%E2%80%99s ability to perform daily%0A                  activities (such as getting dressed, walking and climbing stairs), and may help%0A                  prevent further damage to your/your child%E2%80%99s bones and joints. In addition,%0A                  HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of%0A                  ankylosing spondylitis (back pain and morning stiffness), and adult Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease or ulcerative colitis (abdominal pain and diarrhea). HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is also used to treat inflammatory lesions (nodules and%0A                  abscesses) in adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) also helps reduce the signs and symptoms of psoriasis%0A                  (such as pain, itching and scaly patches on skin). HADLIMATM (or%0A                  HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps control uveitis by reducing the risk of inflammation%0A                  and loss of vision in adult patients. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM), however, can also lower your/your child%E2%80%99s body%E2%80%99s ability to fight%0A                  infections. Taking HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can make you/your child%0A                  more prone to getting infections or make any infection you/your child have%0A                  worse.WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS IN THIS MEDICATION?Medicinal ingredients: adalimumab injection Non-medicinal%0A                  ingredients: citric acid monohydrate, sodium citrate dihydrate, L-histidine, L-%0A                  histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sorbitol, polysorbate 20, water for%0A                  injectionTHIS MEDICATION COMES IN THE FOLLOWING DOSAGE FORMS:Single-use, 1 mL auto-injector containing 40 mg adalimumab injection%0A                    dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL)Single-use, 1 mL pre-filled glass syringe containing 40 mg adalimumab%0A                    injection dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL) All packaging components are latex-free.DO NOT USE THIS MEDICATION IF:You/your child should not take HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) if%0A                  you/your child have:an allergy to any of the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                    (see What are the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or%0A                      HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)? section).a serious infection such as tuberculosis, infections caused by bacteria or%0A                    fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread throughout the body%0A                    (sepsis).moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV).TO HELP AVOID SIDE EFFECTS AND ENSURE PROPER USE, TALK TO YOUR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS MEDICATION.

Some of these cases have been%0A                            life-threatening. Such infections include tuberculosis, infections%0A                            caused by bacteria or fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread%0A                            throughout the body (sepsis). Infection causes include tuberculosis,%0A                            legionellosis (a serious form of bacterial pneumonia), listeriosis (an%0A                            infection that usually develops after eating food contaminated by%0A                            bacteria called listeria), and very rare cases of hepatitis B infection%0A                            relapse.Blood%0A                                problems: In some instances, patients treated%0A                            with TNF-blocking agents may develop low blood counts, such as anemia%0A                            (low red blood cells) or low platelets. If you/your child develop%0A                            symptoms such as persistent fever, bleeding, or bruising, you should%0A                            contact your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right awayWHAT IS THIS MEDICATION USED FOR?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) treatment should be started and%0A                  supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of%0A                  rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA),%0A                  psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), adult Crohn%E2%80%99s disease%0A                  (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), adult hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), psoriasis (Ps)%0A                  or adult uveitis, and familiar with the HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                  efficacy and safety profile. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a%0A                  medicine that is used in:adults with rheumatoid arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints.adults with psoriatic arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints and skin.adults with ankylosing spondylitis, which is a form of arthritis.adults with Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    digestive tract.pediatrics with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who are 4 years%0A                    of age and older and require a full 40 mg dose based on body weight and%0A                    height.adults with ulcerative colitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    bowel (colon).adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) who have not%0A                    responded to antibiotics. HS is a painful, progressive, chronic inflammatory%0A                    skin disease that causes nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts and fistulas under the%0A                    breasts, underarms, buttocks and groin.adults with psoriasis, which is an inflammatory disease of the skin. The%0A                    doctor prescribed HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and%0A                    symptoms of your plaque psoriasis.adults with uveitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the eye. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic%0A                  arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, hidradenitis suppurativa,%0A                  psoriasis, or uveitis may be given other medicines for their disease before they%0A                  are given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM). If you have ulcerative colitis or%0A                  Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond%0A                  well enough to these medicines, you will be given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. HOW DOES THIS MEDICATION WORK?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a fully human monoclonal antibody%0A                  produced by cultured cells. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognize and%0A                  bind to other unique proteins. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) binds to a%0A                  specific protein called TNF- alpha (also known as tumor necrosis factor). People%0A                  with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease, ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa or psoriasis have too much%0A                  of TNF-alpha in their bodies. The extra TNF-alpha in your/your child%E2%80%99s body can%0A                  attack normal healthy body tissues and cause inflammation, especially in the%0A                  tissues of your /your child%E2%80%99s bones, cartilage, joints, digestive tract and skin.%0A                  By binding to TNF-alpha, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) decreases the%0A                  inflammation process of these diseases. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis,%0A                  polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis (such as pain%0A                  and swollen joints), may help improve your/your child%E2%80%99s ability to perform daily%0A                  activities (such as getting dressed, walking and climbing stairs), and may help%0A                  prevent further damage to your/your child%E2%80%99s bones and joints. In addition,%0A                  HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of%0A                  ankylosing spondylitis (back pain and morning stiffness), and adult Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease or ulcerative colitis (abdominal pain and diarrhea). HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is also used to treat inflammatory lesions (nodules and%0A                  abscesses) in adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) also helps reduce the signs and symptoms of psoriasis%0A                  (such as pain, itching and scaly patches on skin). HADLIMATM (or%0A                  HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps control uveitis by reducing the risk of inflammation%0A                  and loss of vision in adult patients. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM), however, can also lower your/your child%E2%80%99s body%E2%80%99s ability to fight%0A                  infections. Taking HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can make you/your child%0A                  more prone to getting infections or make any infection you/your child have%0A                  worse.WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS IN THIS MEDICATION?Medicinal ingredients: adalimumab injection Non-medicinal%0A                  ingredients: citric acid monohydrate, sodium citrate dihydrate, L-histidine, L-%0A                  histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sorbitol, polysorbate 20, water for%0A                  injectionTHIS MEDICATION COMES IN THE FOLLOWING DOSAGE FORMS:Single-use, 1 mL auto-injector containing 40 mg adalimumab injection%0A                    dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL)Single-use, 1 mL pre-filled glass syringe containing 40 mg adalimumab%0A                    injection dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL) All packaging components are latex-free.DO NOT USE THIS MEDICATION IF:You/your child should not take HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) if%0A                  you/your child have:an allergy to any of the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                    (see What are the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or%0A                      HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)? section).a serious infection such as tuberculosis, infections caused by bacteria or%0A                    fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread throughout the body%0A                    (sepsis).moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV).TO HELP AVOID SIDE EFFECTS AND ENSURE PROPER USE, TALK TO YOUR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS MEDICATION.

Most patients had also been treated with%0A                            other medications for Crohn%E2%80%99s disease and the majority were in%0A                            adolescent and young adult males. The link between HSTCL and adalimumab%0A                            injection is not clear.Other%0A                                cancers: There have been very rare cases of%0A                            certain kinds of cancer in patients taking adalimumab injection or other%0A                            TNF-blockers. Some patients receiving adalimumab injection have%0A                            developed types of cancer called non-melanoma skin cancer.

HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a%0A                  medicine that is used in:adults with rheumatoid arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints.adults with psoriatic arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints and skin.adults with ankylosing spondylitis, which is a form of arthritis.adults with Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    digestive tract.pediatrics with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who are 4 years%0A                    of age and older and require a full 40 mg dose based on body weight and%0A                    height.adults with ulcerative colitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    bowel (colon).adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) who have not%0A                    responded to antibiotics. HS is a painful, progressive, chronic inflammatory%0A                    skin disease that causes nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts and fistulas under the%0A                    breasts, underarms, buttocks and groin.adults with psoriasis, which is an inflammatory disease of the skin. The%0A                    doctor prescribed HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and%0A                    symptoms of your plaque psoriasis.adults with uveitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the eye. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic%0A                  arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, hidradenitis suppurativa,%0A                  psoriasis, or uveitis may be given other medicines for their disease before they%0A                  are given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM). If you have ulcerative colitis or%0A                  Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond%0A                  well enough to these medicines, you will be given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. HOW DOES THIS MEDICATION WORK?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a fully human monoclonal antibody%0A                  produced by cultured cells. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognize and%0A                  bind to other unique proteins. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) binds to a%0A                  specific protein called TNF- alpha (also known as tumor necrosis factor). People%0A                  with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease, ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa or psoriasis have too much%0A                  of TNF-alpha in their bodies. The extra TNF-alpha in your/your child%E2%80%99s body can%0A                  attack normal healthy body tissues and cause inflammation, especially in the%0A                  tissues of your /your child%E2%80%99s bones, cartilage, joints, digestive tract and skin.%0A                  By binding to TNF-alpha, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) decreases the%0A                  inflammation process of these diseases. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis,%0A                  polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis (such as pain%0A                  and swollen joints), may help improve your/your child%E2%80%99s ability to perform daily%0A                  activities (such as getting dressed, walking and climbing stairs), and may help%0A                  prevent further damage to your/your child%E2%80%99s bones and joints. In addition,%0A                  HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of%0A                  ankylosing spondylitis (back pain and morning stiffness), and adult Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease or ulcerative colitis (abdominal pain and diarrhea). HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is also used to treat inflammatory lesions (nodules and%0A                  abscesses) in adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) also helps reduce the signs and symptoms of psoriasis%0A                  (such as pain, itching and scaly patches on skin). HADLIMATM (or%0A                  HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps control uveitis by reducing the risk of inflammation%0A                  and loss of vision in adult patients. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM), however, can also lower your/your child%E2%80%99s body%E2%80%99s ability to fight%0A                  infections. Taking HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can make you/your child%0A                  more prone to getting infections or make any infection you/your child have%0A                  worse.WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS IN THIS MEDICATION?Medicinal ingredients: adalimumab injection Non-medicinal%0A                  ingredients: citric acid monohydrate, sodium citrate dihydrate, L-histidine, L-%0A                  histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sorbitol, polysorbate 20, water for%0A                  injectionTHIS MEDICATION COMES IN THE FOLLOWING DOSAGE FORMS:Single-use, 1 mL auto-injector containing 40 mg adalimumab injection%0A                    dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL)Single-use, 1 mL pre-filled glass syringe containing 40 mg adalimumab%0A                    injection dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL) All packaging components are latex-free.DO NOT USE THIS MEDICATION IF:You/your child should not take HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) if%0A                  you/your child have:an allergy to any of the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                    (see What are the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or%0A                      HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)? section).a serious infection such as tuberculosis, infections caused by bacteria or%0A                    fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread throughout the body%0A                    (sepsis).moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV).TO HELP AVOID SIDE EFFECTS AND ENSURE PROPER USE, TALK TO YOUR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS MEDICATION.

HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a%0A                  medicine that is used in:adults with rheumatoid arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints.adults with psoriatic arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints and skin.adults with ankylosing spondylitis, which is a form of arthritis.adults with Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    digestive tract.pediatrics with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who are 4 years%0A                    of age and older and require a full 40 mg dose based on body weight and%0A                    height.adults with ulcerative colitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    bowel (colon).adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) who have not%0A                    responded to antibiotics. HS is a painful, progressive, chronic inflammatory%0A                    skin disease that causes nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts and fistulas under the%0A                    breasts, underarms, buttocks and groin.adults with psoriasis, which is an inflammatory disease of the skin. The%0A                    doctor prescribed HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and%0A                    symptoms of your plaque psoriasis.adults with uveitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the eye. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic%0A                  arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, hidradenitis suppurativa,%0A                  psoriasis, or uveitis may be given other medicines for their disease before they%0A                  are given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM). If you have ulcerative colitis or%0A                  Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond%0A                  well enough to these medicines, you will be given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. HOW DOES THIS MEDICATION WORK?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a fully human monoclonal antibody%0A                  produced by cultured cells. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognize and%0A                  bind to other unique proteins. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) binds to a%0A                  specific protein called TNF- alpha (also known as tumor necrosis factor). People%0A                  with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease, ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa or psoriasis have too much%0A                  of TNF-alpha in their bodies. The extra TNF-alpha in your/your child%E2%80%99s body can%0A                  attack normal healthy body tissues and cause inflammation, especially in the%0A                  tissues of your /your child%E2%80%99s bones, cartilage, joints, digestive tract and skin.%0A                  By binding to TNF-alpha, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) decreases the%0A                  inflammation process of these diseases. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis,%0A                  polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis (such as pain%0A                  and swollen joints), may help improve your/your child%E2%80%99s ability to perform daily%0A                  activities (such as getting dressed, walking and climbing stairs), and may help%0A                  prevent further damage to your/your child%E2%80%99s bones and joints. In addition,%0A                  HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of%0A                  ankylosing spondylitis (back pain and morning stiffness), and adult Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease or ulcerative colitis (abdominal pain and diarrhea). HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is also used to treat inflammatory lesions (nodules and%0A                  abscesses) in adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) also helps reduce the signs and symptoms of psoriasis%0A                  (such as pain, itching and scaly patches on skin). HADLIMATM (or%0A                  HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps control uveitis by reducing the risk of inflammation%0A                  and loss of vision in adult patients. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM), however, can also lower your/your child%E2%80%99s body%E2%80%99s ability to fight%0A                  infections. Taking HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can make you/your child%0A                  more prone to getting infections or make any infection you/your child have%0A                  worse.WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS IN THIS MEDICATION?Medicinal ingredients: adalimumab injection Non-medicinal%0A                  ingredients: citric acid monohydrate, sodium citrate dihydrate, L-histidine, L-%0A                  histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sorbitol, polysorbate 20, water for%0A                  injectionTHIS MEDICATION COMES IN THE FOLLOWING DOSAGE FORMS:Single-use, 1 mL auto-injector containing 40 mg adalimumab injection%0A                    dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL)Single-use, 1 mL pre-filled glass syringe containing 40 mg adalimumab%0A                    injection dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL) All packaging components are latex-free.DO NOT USE THIS MEDICATION IF:You/your child should not take HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) if%0A                  you/your child have:an allergy to any of the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                    (see What are the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or%0A                      HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)? section).a serious infection such as tuberculosis, infections caused by bacteria or%0A                    fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread throughout the body%0A                    (sepsis).moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV).TO HELP AVOID SIDE EFFECTS AND ENSURE PROPER USE, TALK TO YOUR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS MEDICATION.

Most patients had also been treated with%0A                            other medications for Crohn%E2%80%99s disease and the majority were in%0A                            adolescent and young adult males. The link between HSTCL and adalimumab%0A                            injection is not clear.Other%0A                                cancers: There have been very rare cases of%0A                            certain kinds of cancer in patients taking adalimumab injection or other%0A                            TNF-blockers. Some patients receiving adalimumab injection have%0A                            developed types of cancer called non-melanoma skin cancer. Tell%0A                            your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor if you/your child have a bump or open sore that%0A                            does not heal. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have%0A                            had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of%0A                            getting a kind of cancer that affects the lymph system, called lymphoma.%0A                            If you/your child take HADLIMATM, HADLIMATM PushTouchTM, or other TNF-%0A                            blockers, your/your child%E2%80%99s risk may increase. There have been cases of%0A                            lymphoma and other cancers, including unusual types, in children,%0A                            adolescents and young adults taking TNF-blocking agents, including%0A                            adalimumab injection, which sometimes resulted in death. For children%0A                            and adults taking TNF-blocker medicines, the chances of developing%0A                            lymphoma or other cancers may increase.Lupus-like%0A                                symptoms: Some patients have developed%0A                            lupus-like symptoms that got better after their treatment was stopped.%0A                            If you/your child have chest pains that do not go away, shortness of%0A                            breath, joint pain or a rash on your/your child%E2%80%99s cheeks or arms that%0A                            gets worse in the sun, call your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right away.%0A                            Your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor may decide to stop your/your child%E2%80%99s%0A                            treatment.Nervous%0A                                system diseases: There have been rare cases of%0A                            disorders that affect the nervous system of people taking adalimumab%0A                            injection or other TNF-blockers. Signs that you/your child could be%0A                            experiencing a problem affecting your/your child%E2%80%99s nervous system%0A                            include: numbness or tingling, problems with your/your child%E2%80%99s vision,%0A                            weakness in your/your child%E2%80%99s legs, and dizziness.Serious%0A                                infections: There have been rare cases where%0A                            patients taking adalimumab injection or other TNF-blocking agents have%0A                            developed serious infections. Some of these cases have been%0A                            life-threatening. Such infections include tuberculosis, infections%0A                            caused by bacteria or fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread%0A                            throughout the body (sepsis). Infection causes include tuberculosis,%0A                            legionellosis (a serious form of bacterial pneumonia), listeriosis (an%0A                            infection that usually develops after eating food contaminated by%0A                            bacteria called listeria), and very rare cases of hepatitis B infection%0A                            relapse.Blood%0A                                problems: In some instances, patients treated%0A                            with TNF-blocking agents may develop low blood counts, such as anemia%0A                            (low red blood cells) or low platelets. If you/your child develop%0A                            symptoms such as persistent fever, bleeding, or bruising, you should%0A                            contact your/your child%E2%80%99s doctor right awayWHAT IS THIS MEDICATION USED FOR?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) treatment should be started and%0A                  supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of%0A                  rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA),%0A                  psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), adult Crohn%E2%80%99s disease%0A                  (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), adult hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), psoriasis (Ps)%0A                  or adult uveitis, and familiar with the HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                  efficacy and safety profile. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a%0A                  medicine that is used in:adults with rheumatoid arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints.adults with psoriatic arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    joints and skin.adults with ankylosing spondylitis, which is a form of arthritis.adults with Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    digestive tract.pediatrics with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who are 4 years%0A                    of age and older and require a full 40 mg dose based on body weight and%0A                    height.adults with ulcerative colitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the%0A                    bowel (colon).adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) who have not%0A                    responded to antibiotics. HS is a painful, progressive, chronic inflammatory%0A                    skin disease that causes nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts and fistulas under the%0A                    breasts, underarms, buttocks and groin.adults with psoriasis, which is an inflammatory disease of the skin. The%0A                    doctor prescribed HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and%0A                    symptoms of your plaque psoriasis.adults with uveitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the eye. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic%0A                  arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, hidradenitis suppurativa,%0A                  psoriasis, or uveitis may be given other medicines for their disease before they%0A                  are given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM). If you have ulcerative colitis or%0A                  Crohn%E2%80%99s disease, you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond%0A                  well enough to these medicines, you will be given HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. HOW DOES THIS MEDICATION WORK?HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is a fully human monoclonal antibody%0A                  produced by cultured cells. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognize and%0A                  bind to other unique proteins. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) binds to a%0A                  specific protein called TNF- alpha (also known as tumor necrosis factor). People%0A                  with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease, ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa or psoriasis have too much%0A                  of TNF-alpha in their bodies. The extra TNF-alpha in your/your child%E2%80%99s body can%0A                  attack normal healthy body tissues and cause inflammation, especially in the%0A                  tissues of your /your child%E2%80%99s bones, cartilage, joints, digestive tract and skin.%0A                  By binding to TNF-alpha, HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) decreases the%0A                  inflammation process of these diseases. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis,%0A                  polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis (such as pain%0A                  and swollen joints), may help improve your/your child%E2%80%99s ability to perform daily%0A                  activities (such as getting dressed, walking and climbing stairs), and may help%0A                  prevent further damage to your/your child%E2%80%99s bones and joints. In addition,%0A                  HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps reduce the signs and symptoms of%0A                  ankylosing spondylitis (back pain and morning stiffness), and adult Crohn%E2%80%99s%0A                  disease or ulcerative colitis (abdominal pain and diarrhea). HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) is also used to treat inflammatory lesions (nodules and%0A                  abscesses) in adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. HADLIMATM%0A                  (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) also helps reduce the signs and symptoms of psoriasis%0A                  (such as pain, itching and scaly patches on skin). HADLIMATM (or%0A                  HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) helps control uveitis by reducing the risk of inflammation%0A                  and loss of vision in adult patients. HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM%0A                  PushTouchTM), however, can also lower your/your child%E2%80%99s body%E2%80%99s ability to fight%0A                  infections. Taking HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) can make you/your child%0A                  more prone to getting infections or make any infection you/your child have%0A                  worse.WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS IN THIS MEDICATION?Medicinal ingredients: adalimumab injection Non-medicinal%0A                  ingredients: citric acid monohydrate, sodium citrate dihydrate, L-histidine, L-%0A                  histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sorbitol, polysorbate 20, water for%0A                  injectionTHIS MEDICATION COMES IN THE FOLLOWING DOSAGE FORMS:Single-use, 1 mL auto-injector containing 40 mg adalimumab injection%0A                    dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL)Single-use, 1 mL pre-filled glass syringe containing 40 mg adalimumab%0A                    injection dissolved in 0.8 mL sterile solution (50 mg/mL) All packaging components are latex-free.DO NOT USE THIS MEDICATION IF:You/your child should not take HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM) if%0A                  you/your child have:an allergy to any of the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)%0A                    (see What are the ingredients in HADLIMATM (or%0A                      HADLIMATM PushTouchTM)? section).a serious infection such as tuberculosis, infections caused by bacteria or%0A                    fungi, and bacterial infections that have spread throughout the body%0A                    (sepsis).moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV).TO HELP AVOID SIDE EFFECTS AND ENSURE PROPER USE, TALK TO YOUR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS MEDICATION.
