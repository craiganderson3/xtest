General A case of rare but fatal angioedema had occurred in a patient who%0A                  had been medicated for about 6 months with telmisartan, one of the active%0A                  components of TWYNSTA. The Autopsy Report described evidence of edema of the%0A                  laryngeal mucosa, with terminal respiratory and circulatory failure. This is in%0A                  the context of approximately 5.2 million patient-years exposure to telmisartan%0A                  annually.  If laryngeal stridor or angioedema of the face, extremities,%0A                  lips, tongue, or glottis occurs, TWYNSTA should be discontinued immediately, the%0A                  patient treated appropriately in accordance with accepted medical care, and%0A                  carefully observed until the swelling disappears.

General A case of rare but fatal angioedema had occurred in a patient who%0A                  had been medicated for about 6 months with telmisartan, one of the active%0A                  components of TWYNSTA. The Autopsy Report described evidence of edema of the%0A                  laryngeal mucosa, with terminal respiratory and circulatory failure. This is in%0A                  the context of approximately 5.2 million patient-years exposure to telmisartan%0A                  annually.  If laryngeal stridor or angioedema of the face, extremities,%0A                  lips, tongue, or glottis occurs, TWYNSTA should be discontinued immediately, the%0A                  patient treated appropriately in accordance with accepted medical care, and%0A                  carefully observed until the swelling disappears. In instances where swelling is%0A                  confined to the face and lips, the condition generally resolves without treatment,%0A                  although antihistamines may be useful in relieving symptoms. Where there is%0A                  involvement of tongue, glottis, or larynx, likely to cause airway obstruction,%0A                  appropriate therapy (including, but not limited to 0.3 to 0.5 ml of subcutaneous%0A                  epinephrine solution 1:1000) should be administered promptly (see ADVERSE REACTIONS - Post Marketing%0A                    Adverse Drug Reactions; Telmisartan).

TWYNSTA is not indicated for initial therapy (see DOSAGE AND%0A                        ADMINISTRATION). Patients should be titrated on individual drugs. If the fixed dose%0A                      combination represents the dose and dosing frequency determined by this%0A                      titration, the use of TWYNSTA may be more convenient in the management of%0A                      patients. If during maintenance therapy dosage adjustment is necessary, it is%0A                      advisable to use the individual drugs. Geriatrics: No dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients. It should be%0A                      recognized, however, that greater sensitivity in some older individuals cannot%0A                      be ruled out. Pediatrics (< 18 years of age):%0A                      TWYNSTA is not recommended for use in patients aged below 18 years due to a%0A                      lack of data on safety and efficacy. 1.2 GERIATRICSsample text2 CONTRAINDICATIONS sample text 3 SERIOUS WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS BOXSerious Warnings and PrecautionsWhen used in pregnancy, angiotensin receptor (AT1)%0A                          blockers (ARB) can cause injury or even death of the developing fetus.%0A                          When pregnancy is detected, TWYNSTA should be discontinued as soon as%0A                          possible (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Special Populations). General A case of rare but fatal angioedema had occurred in a patient who%0A                  had been medicated for about 6 months with telmisartan, one of the active%0A                  components of TWYNSTA. The Autopsy Report described evidence of edema of the%0A                  laryngeal mucosa, with terminal respiratory and circulatory failure. This is in%0A                  the context of approximately 5.2 million patient-years exposure to telmisartan%0A                  annually.  If laryngeal stridor or angioedema of the face, extremities,%0A                  lips, tongue, or glottis occurs, TWYNSTA should be discontinued immediately, the%0A                  patient treated appropriately in accordance with accepted medical care, and%0A                  carefully observed until the swelling disappears. In instances where swelling is%0A                  confined to the face and lips, the condition generally resolves without treatment,%0A                  although antihistamines may be useful in relieving symptoms. Where there is%0A                  involvement of tongue, glottis, or larynx, likely to cause airway obstruction,%0A                  appropriate therapy (including, but not limited to 0.3 to 0.5 ml of subcutaneous%0A                  epinephrine solution 1:1000) should be administered promptly (see ADVERSE REACTIONS - Post Marketing%0A                    Adverse Drug Reactions; Telmisartan).

This leaflet is a summary and will not tell you%0A                  everything about TWYNSTA. Talk to your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist about your%0A                  medical condition and treatment and ask if there is any new information about%0A                  TWYNSTA.PROPER NAME IN FINAL DOSAGE FORMS sample text WHAT IS THIS MEDICATION USED FOR?TWYNSTA is used to treat high blood pressure in patients who already%0A                  receive telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets and who wish to take%0A                  instead the same doses in one tablet for convenience.HOW DOES THIS MEDICATION WORK? TWYNSTA contains a combination of 2 drugs, telmisartan and amlodipine: Telmisartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). You can recognize an%0A                    ARB because its medicinal ingredient ends in %E2%80%9C-SARTAN%E2%80%9D.Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker. These medicinal ingredients work together to lower blood pressure. This%0A                  medicine does not cure your disease. It helps to control it. Therefore, it is%0A                  important to continue taking TWYNSTA regularly even if you feel fine. WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS IN THIS MEDICATION? Telmisartan and amlodipine (as amlodipine besylate) colloidal%0A                  anhydrous silica, FD&amp;C blue No 1 aluminium lake, ferric oxide black, ferric%0A                  oxide yellow, magnesium stearate, maize starch, meglumine, microcrystalline%0A                  cellulose, povidone K25, pregelatinized starch, sodium hydroxide, sorbitol.%0A                THIS MEDICATION COMES IN THE FOLLOWING DOSAGE FORMS:Tablets: 40/5 mg, 40/10 mg, 80/5 mg, 80/10 mg.DO NOT USE THIS MEDICATION IF:Serious Warnings and Precautions - Pregnancy TWYNSTA%0A                        should not be used during pregnancy. If you discover that you are pregnant%0A                        while taking TWYNSTA, stop the medication and contact your doctor, nurse, or%0A                        pharmacist as soon as possible. Have experienced an allergic reaction to any drug used to lower blood%0A                    pressure.
